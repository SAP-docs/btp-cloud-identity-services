## Log on with a Social Provider Account

You can log on to applications that use Identity Authentication via your accounts in X, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Google.



## Prerequisites

The applications must be configured to allow logon via social networks.



## Context

Using the social network authentication, you link your Identity Authentication account with your social network account or accounts. After the initial setup, when you link the accounts, you can log on to the applications with your social network credentials.

Identity Authentication has access to the following data from the social providers:

</tr>
</table>

This data is used for the initial linking of your Identity Authentication account with the social network account. Later, if you update the personal information in your social account, the updated information will not be copied by Identity Authentication.

To link your Identity Authentication account with a social network account, proceed as follows:



<a name="xxx__steps_xwd_m2g_pt"/>

## Procedure

1.  Access the application's logon page.

2.  Choose the icon of the social network provider you want to log on with.

    > ### Note:  
    > Which social networks are displayed on the page depends on the application.

3.  Sign in to your social network account.

4.  Choose one of the following options:

    -   Link your Identity Authentication account with your social network account.
    -   Create a new Identity Authentication account that will be linked with your social network account.

        > ### Note:  
        > This option appears only for applications that allow user registration.
