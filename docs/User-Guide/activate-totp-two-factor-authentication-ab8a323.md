# Activate TOTP Two-Factor Authentication

To log on to applications that require time-based one-time password \(TOTP\) as two-factor authentication, first you have to activate a mobile device that will generate TOTP passcodes.



## Prerequisites

-   You have installed a QR code scanner and an authenticator application on your mobile device.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can use third-party authenticators such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator. For more information about how to install and configure the authenticators see their documentation.




## Context

Some applications require two-factor authentication as an additional security to the common static passwords. They will ask you to provide your password and a passcode, generated by a mobile device.

> ### Note:  
> Passcodes are only necessary for applications that require two-factor authentication. You do not need to activate a device for applications that only require passwords for authentication.

You activate a mobile device that generates passcodes.

## Procedure

1.  Access your profile page.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you don't know the URL of your profile page, contact your system administrator.

2.  Open the authenticator application.

3.  Provide your security key and follow the onscreen instructions on the profile page.

    > ### Note:  
    > Skip this step if you activate two-factor authentication for the first time.

4.  Do one of the following on your mobile device:

    -   Scan the QR code from the profile page screen.
    -   Enter the secret key from the profile page screen manually.

5.  Complete the setup on your mobile device.

6.  Enter the passcode generated by the authenticator application in the space provided on the screen on your profile page.

7.  Press *Activate*.

## Results

Now, you can log on to applications that require passcode as an additional security for authentication.

> ### Note:  
> Optionally, you can activate TOTP two-factor authentication when you log on to an application that requires passcode as a second factor. Access the protected page of the application and follow the onscreen instructions.
