# Add a Device for Web Two-Factor Authentication

To log on to applications that require web two-factor authentication \(FIDO2 standard\), first you have to activate an authenticator device.



## Prerequisites

-   Use a browser and platform that supports web authentication.



## Context

Some applications require web two-factor authentication as an additional security to the common static passwords. They ask you to authenticate to the application and use your device to continue the logon.

> ### Note:  
> You can add more than one device for web two-factor authentication.

## Procedure

1.  Access your profile page.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you don't know the URL of your profile page, contact your system administrator.

2.  Press plus button next to *Web Two-Factor Authentication*.

3.  Verify your identity by choosing a verification method and follow the onscreen instructions.

    > ### Note:
