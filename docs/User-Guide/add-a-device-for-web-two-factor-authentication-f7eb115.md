# Add a Device for Web Two-Factor Authentication

To log on to applications that require web two-factor authentication \(FIDO2 standard\), first you have to activate an authenticator device.



## Prerequisites

-   Use a browser and platform that supports web authentication.



## Context

Some applications require web two-factor authentication as an additional security to the common static passwords. They ask you to authenticate to the application and use your device to continue the logon.

> ### Note:  
> You can add more than one device for web two-factor authentication.
