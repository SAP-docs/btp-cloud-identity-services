# Customer Data

Customer can request export of its customer data in a JSON format by reporting an incident on [SAP Support Portal Home](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html) with a component `BC-IAM-IDS`. The request can be for full data export or selected data export according to the customer requirements.

When using Identity Provisioning, you can clear the customer data \(systems, jobs, execution logs\). You need to sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Tenant Reset*. For more information, see [Reset Identity Provisioning Tenant](../Operation-Guide/reset-identity-provisioning-tenant-8c7ba9a.md).
