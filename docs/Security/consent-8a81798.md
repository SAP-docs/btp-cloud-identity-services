# Consent

We assume that software operators, such as SAP customers, collect and store the consent of data subjects, before collecting personal data from data subjects. A data privacy specialist can later determine whether data subjects have granted, withdrawn, or denied consent.

Every \(service provider\) application that trusts Identity Authentication can configure its own privacy policy and terms of use documents. For more information, see [Configuring Privacy Policies](../Operation-Guide/configuring-privacy-policies-ed48466.md), and [Configuring Terms of Use](../Operation-Guide/configuring-terms-of-use-61d3a86.md).

Identity Authentication takes care the documents to be accepted by the users. Whenever a new version of the document becomes available, an upgrade process is started.

The end users can view the signed **Terms of Use** and **Privacy Policy** documents by them at the profile page. For more information, see [Information Report](information-report-cb2c243.md).

The tenant administrators can view a history of the signed **Terms of Use** and **Privacy Policy** documents of the users in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. The information is in the format *<document name\><document version\><time stamp\>*.

> ### Note:  
> The information about when the user has accepted a particular document is available for documents accepted after May 16, 2018.

To view that information, access *Administration Console* \> *Users & Authorizations* \> *User Management* \> *User Name* \> *Legal tab*. For more information about how to view the user information in the administration console, see [List and Edit User Details](../Operation-Guide/list-and-edit-user-details-045cb01.md).
