# Data Protection and Privacy

Governments place legal requirements on industry to protect data and privacy. We provide features and functions to help you meet these requirements.

> ### Note:  
> SAP does not provide legal advice in any form. SAP software supports data protection compliance by providing security features and data protection-relevant functions, such as blocking and deletion of personal data. In many cases, compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws is not covered by a product feature. Furthermore, this information should not be taken as advice or a recommendation regarding additional features that would be required in specific IT environments. Decisions related to data protection must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the given system landscape and the applicable legal requirements. Definitions and other terms used in this documentation are not taken from a specific legal source.

Handle personal data with care. You as the data controller are legally responsible when processing personal data. It is not permitted to deal with sensitive personal data in Identity Authentication.
