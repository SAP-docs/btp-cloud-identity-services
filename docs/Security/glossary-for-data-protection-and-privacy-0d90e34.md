**Where-used check \(WUC\)** 

</td>
<td valign="top">

A process designed to ensure data integrity in the case of potential blocking of business partner data. An application's where-used check \(WUC\) determines if there is any dependent data for a certain business partner in the database. If dependent data exists, this means the data is still required for business activities. Therefore, the blocking of business partners referenced in the data is prevented.
