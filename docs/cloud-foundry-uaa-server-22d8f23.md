# Cloud Foundry UAA Server

Follow this procedure to set up a Cloud Foundry UAA Server as а target system.



<a name="loio22d8f23d6d7e4d2fb0bf72090417482b__prereq_rjs_2yp_wy"/>

## Prerequisites

> ### Restriction:  
> This system is available for standalone tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure and SAP BTP, Neo environment. Bundle tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity Services infrastructure and Neo environment can use it only through **SAP Identity Access Governance** bundle option.

-   You have technical user credentials for a Cloud Foundry system with write access permissions. In case OAuth is used for authentication, client ID and secret are required when creating a destination for access token retrieval. You need Cloud Foundry UAA version **4.2** or higher
-   \(Optional\) You have installed the Cloud Connector in your corporate environment and have done the initial configuration. You need to do this only if the Cloud Foundry UAA server is exposed in a private corporate network. For more information, see [Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html).



## Context

User Account and Authentication Service \(UAA\) is an OAuth2 server that you can use for centralized identity management. It owns the user accounts and authentication sources and supports standard protocols \(such as *SAML*, *LDAP*, and *OpenID Connect*\) to provide SSO and delegated authorization to Web applications. For more information, see [Cloud Foundry: Overview](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.20.0/index.html#overview).

> ### Tip:  
> This connector is meant for writing users and groups in **general** Cloud Foundry systems \(they could be non-SAP ones\). If you want to trigger provisioning of entities to SAP Business Technology Platform Cloud Foundry applications, you'd better use [SAP BTP XS Advanced UAA \(Cloud Foundry\)](sap-btp-xs-advanced-uaa-cloud-foundry-ecddce6.md) target system.

These target systems consume SCIM 1.1 API provided by Cloud Foundry UAA.

> ### Remember:  
> You can write users and groups to Cloud Foundry on **application** level only. You cannot provision or manage them on a *subaccount* level.

Follow the steps below to create Cloud Foundry UAA as a target system to provision users and groups.



## Procedure

1.  \(Optional\) If the Cloud Foundry UAA server is exposed in a private corporate network, add an access control system mapping in Cloud Connector. For more information, see [Configure Access Control \(HTTP\)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e7d4927dbb571014af7ef6ebd6cc3511.html).

2.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Bundle Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/7ab5884ffbc44461a57622d2f633e57c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning UI when the service is bundled as part of an SAP cloud solution's license.") :arrow_upper_right:
    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

3.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Target Systems*.

4.  Add *Cloud Foundry UAA Server* as a target system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

5.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

    `uaa.origin`=*my\_UAA\_location*
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
6.  \(Optional\) Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *Cloud Foundry UAA Server* target system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    -   **Mapping logic** – The behavior of the default transformation logic is to map all attributes from the internal Cloud Foundry UAA representation to the target entity.
    -   **User offboarding** – If a user has been deleted from the source system, this change is recognized, and the user is deleted from the Cloud Foundry UAA target system too.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules to reflect your current setup of entities in your Cloud Foundry UAA server. For more information, see:

    [Manage Transformations](Operation-Guide/manage-transformations-2d0fbe5.md)

    [Cloud Foundry UAA API: Users](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.20.0/index.html#users)

    [Cloud Foundry UAA API: Groups](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/4.20.0/index.html#groups)

    To make group assignments via the user resource, you need to change the default transformation of the target system as described in [Enabling Group Assignment](Operation-Guide/enabling-group-assignment-0d80033.md).

    **Default transformation:**

7.  Now, add a source system from which to read users and groups. Choose from: [Source Systems](source-systems-58033be.md)

## Next Steps

-   Before starting a provisioning job, you can first subscribe for e-mail notifications from the source system you use in your scenario. This way, you will be notified by e-mail about eventual failed entities during the jobs. For more information, see [Manage Job Notifications](Monitoring-and-Reporting/manage-job-notifications-d055bc2.md).
-   Now, start an identity provisioning job. For more information, see [Monitor Provisioning Job Logs](Monitoring-and-Reporting/monitor-provisioning-job-logs-e5b5176.md).
