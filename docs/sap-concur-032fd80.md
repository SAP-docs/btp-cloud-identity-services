# SAP Concur

Follow this procedure to set up SAP Concur as a target system.



## Prerequisites

> ### Restriction:  
> This system is available for bundle tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure and standalone tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure and SAP BTP, Neo environment. Bundle tenants running on Neo environment can use it only through **SAP Identity Access Governance** bundle option.

You are using User v1 API, Identity v4 API or SCIM v4 API.

-   You have an SAP Concur admin user with *Web Services Administrator* role assigned.

-   Your SAP Concur admin user has obtained a *Company Request Token* and a *Company UUID* from the SAP Concur Company Request Token self-service tool.

    For more information, see [SAP Concur Company Request Token](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CONCUR/83c94f03f949423a8f76158375832747/1b9040cf6caf1014a483f58a84015038.html).

    > ### Note:  
    > The **User v1 API** has been decommissioned. For more information, see [Concur User API Decommission](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/FAQ_Concur_USER_EXTERNAL.pdf).

## Context

Companies that use SAP Concur for managing and controlling travel expenses, invoices and other can use Identity Provisioning service to automate the identity and access management for the SAP Concur solution. This service allows you to provision identity data from your existing corporate identity stores, such as SAP AS ABAP or Microsoft Active Directory, or provision employee user data from different SAP cloud user stores, such as SAP SuccessFactors or SAP Cloud Identity Service – Identity Authentication.

The SAP Concur integration with Identity Provisioning is supported with Standard and Professional editions.

SAP Concur provides different APIs for integration with Identity Provisioning, resulting in different connector versions. Each connector version supports specific attribute mappings within the transformations and requires particular property values. The value of the `concur.api.version` property controls which API you use.

-   When the value is set to `3`, the SCIM v4 API is used. It supports provisioning of users and group assignments.

    > ### Note:  
    > Identity Provisioning cannot create and delete groups in SAP Concur target system. It can only create, update and delete user assignments of a group. Therefore, groups must have been created in SAP Concur system before you run a provisioning job.

    By default, the Identity Provisioning service uses version 3 for all newly created systems starting December 2, 2025, when version 3 was introduced. The default version is the latest released connector version at the time the system is created.

-   When the value is set to `2`, the Identity v4 API is used. This applies to systems created between December 8, 2021, and December 1, 2025. Identity v4 API supports provisioning of users with the `userUUID` attribute, which is generated by Identity Authentication at user creation.

-   When the value is set to `1`, or the property is not defined, the User v1 API is used. This applies to systems created before versioning was introduced on December 8, 2021. Version 1 is deprecated.


For more information on how to update to the connector version you need, see: [Update Connector Version](Operation-Guide/update-connector-version-8558733.md).

To create SAP Concur as a target system, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Bundle Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/7ab5884ffbc44461a57622d2f633e57c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning UI when the service is bundled as part of an SAP cloud solution's license.") :arrow_upper_right:
    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

2.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Target Systems*.

3.  Add *SAP Concur* as a target system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

4.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your Identity Provisioning tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

    To learn what additional properties are relevant to this system, see [List of Properties](list-of-properties-d6f3577.md). You can use the main search, or filter properties by the *Name* or *System Type* columns.

5.  Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *SAP Concur* target system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules to reflect your current setup of entities in your SAP Concur. For more information, see:

    -   **Mapping logic** – When the SAP Concur system is configured as a target, the default transformation logic offered by the Identity Provisioning service contains the minimum of required properties for the successful provisioning of the users. You can change the default transformation mapping rules to reflect your current setup of entities in the source system. Before you start extending the default transformation, you have to get familiar with the requirements of the SAP Concur API to avoid inconsistencies. For more information, see [User v1](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/user/index.html).
    -   **User off-boarding** – Identity Provisioning service handles the end-to-end lifecycle of the users, including their off-boarding. For some source systems, the deletion of a user or inactive user status is the final step of this lifecycle process. The SAP Concur solution, however, does not allow user accounts to be deleted. The offboarding of SAP Concur user accounts is always performed by setting them as disabled. When a user is deleted or set with status **inactive** in a system configured as a source for user data provisioning to SAP Concur, the user account in SAP Concur will be disabled \(the attribute `"targetPath": "$.Active"` gets a value “**N**”\).

    > ### Caution:  
    > The User v1 API requires an initial password setup for all newly provisioned user accounts. The default transformation offers a statement with an empty string as a value for the password configuration. However, it is ignored in order to prevent from a default setup of a wrong initial password for your systems. While the password statement is ignored, the provisioning will not be working. To enable the provisioning to SAP Concur, you need to perform the following operations:
    > 
    > 1.  Enable the password statement. To do this, either delete **"ignore": true,** or set it as **"ignore": false**.
    > 2.  Set a proper statement for the password attribute value \(**"targetPath": "$.Password"**\).
    > 
    > \(Optional\) You can leave the default empty string, or you can use the **randomPassword** function to calculate a random value for the initial password of the newly created SAP Concur accounts. If you choose one of these two options and if you are not using single sign-on solution for SAP Concur, you have to also arrange a password reset support process in your company. This will securely offer an initial password to your corporate users for their newly created SAP Concur accounts. For more information, see [Transformation Expressions](transformation-expressions-bb8537b.md) → **Transformation Functions**.

    The Identity Provisioning does not provide group resource mapping in the SAP Concur write transformation. Although you cannot provision groups to SAP Concur, you can group the users into organizational units by enhancing your target transformation as follows:

    > ### Note:  
    > The default transformation for Concur connector version 2 \(based on Identity v4 API\) provides a mapping that generates the Concur User Login\_ID based on the username from the source \(Login Name in SAP Cloud Identity Services\) and the domain configured as the `concur.company.domain` property.

    In SAP Concur connector version 3, *phoneNumbers* and *emails* require a type \(such as *work*, *home*, mobile\). One phone number and one email are allowed per type, except for *mobile* phone numbers, where multiple entries are permitted. If multiple mobile phone numbers are present, at least one must be primary. When a phone number has no type, Identity Provisioning sets it to *mobile*. When an email has no type, the service sets it to *work*.

    A user may have multiple phone numbers, emails and addresses in a given source system. By using the *elementAt* function, only the first element in the array will be retrieved. This function can be applied to phone numbers, emails, or addresses:

    > ### Code Syntax:  
    > ```
    > {
    >    "condition":"$.phoneNumbers[?(@.type == 'work')] empty false",
    >    "sourcePath":"$.phoneNumbers[?(@.type == 'work')]",
    >    "optional":true,
    >    "preserveArrayWithSingleElement":true,
    >    "targetPath":"$.phoneNumbers[0]",
    >    "functions":[
    >       {
    >          "function":"elementAt",
    >          "index":0
    >       }
    >    ]
    > }
    > ```

    The *address* attribute does not require a type. If a type is provided, only one address per type is allowed.

6.  Now, add a source system from which to read users. Choose from: [Source Systems](source-systems-58033be.md)

## Next Steps

-   Before starting a provisioning job, you can first subscribe for e-mail notifications from the source system you use in your scenario. This way, you will be notified by e-mail about eventual failed entities during the jobs. For more information, see [Manage Job Notifications](Monitoring-and-Reporting/manage-job-notifications-d055bc2.md).
-   Start an identity provisioning job. For more information, see [Monitor Provisioning Job Logs](Monitoring-and-Reporting/monitor-provisioning-job-logs-e5b5176.md).
