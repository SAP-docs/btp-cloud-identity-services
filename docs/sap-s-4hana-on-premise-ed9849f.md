# SAP S/4HANA On-Premise

Follow this procedure to set up SAP S/4HANA on-premise \(also valid for SAP S/4HANA Cloud, private edition\) as a source system.



<a name="loioed9849f67d934351a989be908e4a06b8__prereq_tcl_4r3_kfb"/>

## Prerequisites

> ### Note:  
> If you have purchased the Identity Provisioning service between **September 1, 2020** and **October 20, 2020**, and you want to make a connection to this on-premise system, follow the procedure in: [Connect to On-Premise Systems in SAP Cloud Identity Infrastructure](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/connect-to-on-premise-systems-in-sap-cloud-identity-infrastructure?version=Cloud).

-   You have installed the Cloud Connector in your corporate environment and have done the initial configuration. For more information, see: [Cloud Connector \(Neo\)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b865ed651e414196b39f8922db2122c7/Cloud/en-US/d751d065774e45e1b6bdbfdfd541da13.html)
-   You have technical credentials \(user and password\) for SAP S/4HANA on-premise.
-   The SAP S/4HANA on-premise system is version **1809** or higher.
-   You have configured your SOA Manager to directly call the following Web services:

    -   **ManageBusinessUserIn**
    -   **QueryBusinessUserIn**

    For more information, see: [Setting Up SOA Manager](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM/684cffda9cbc4187ad7dad790b03b983/e9c0c9faead44086b1d9a88da63bdaae.html?version=latest).




## Context

You can use Identity Provisioning to configure SAP S/4HANA on-premise as a source system where you can read **business users** \(employee, collaboration user, contingent worker, and resource\) from and provision them to a target system.

In SAP S/4HANA, a business user is defined as a natural person who is represented by a business partner and a link to a user in the system. Actually, the business user is an AS ABAP \(SU01\) user who also has a one-to-one relation to a corresponding business partner. For more information on the identity model for business users, see SAP Note [2570961](https://me.sap.com/notes/2570961).

SAP S/4HANA on-premise supports reading of users with *User UUID* attribute which is generated by Identity Authentication at user creation. The attribute mapping is handled by the default transformation of SAP AS ABAP connector. Therefore, in order to read a user with *User UUID* from S/4HANA on-premise, the user should first be created \(provisioned\) in AS ABAP and then linked to its corresponding business user in S/4HANA on-premise. For more information, see: [SAP Application Server ABAP](sap-application-server-abap-5235087.md).

Reading of **roles** \(considered as *groups*\) is also handled by the default transformation SAP AS ABAP connector.



## Procedure

1.  Open the Cloud Connector to add an access control system mapping for **SAP S/4HANA On-Premise**. This is needed to allow the Identity Provisioning service to access SAP S/4HANA On-Premise as a back-end system on the intranet. To learn how, see: [Configure Access Control \(HTTP\)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b865ed651e414196b39f8922db2122c7/Cloud/en-US/e7d4927dbb571014af7ef6ebd6cc3511.html)

2.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Bundle Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/7ab5884ffbc44461a57622d2f633e57c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning UI when the service is bundled as part of an SAP cloud solution's license.") :arrow_upper_right:
    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

3.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Source Systems*.

4.  Add *SAP S/4HANA On-Premise* as a source system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

5.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

6.  \(Optional\) Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *SAP S/4HANA On-Premise* source system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules depending on your setup of entities in SAP S/4HANA On-Premise. For more information, see:

7.  Now, add a target system to provision users into it. Choose from: [Target Systems](target-systems-ab3f641.md)

## Next Steps

-   Before starting a provisioning job, you can first subscribe for e-mail notifications from the source system you use in your scenario. This way, you will be notified by e-mail about eventual failed entities during the jobs. For more information, see [Manage Job Notifications](Monitoring-and-Reporting/manage-job-notifications-d055bc2.md).
-   Start an identity provisioning job. For more information, see [Monitor Provisioning Job Logs](Monitoring-and-Reporting/monitor-provisioning-job-logs-e5b5176.md).
