## Context

We recommend that you protect the access to the administration console with two-factor authentication \(TFA\). Requesting additional means of identity verification provides enhanced security.

The initial administrator configures the access to this application under *Applications & Resources* \> *Applications* \> *System Applications* \> *Administration Console* \> *Authentication and Access*, where the TFA method must be defined as a default authentication rule under *Risk-Based Authentication*.

For more information, see [Configure Risk-Based Authentication for an Application](Operation-Guide/configure-risk-based-authentication-for-an-application-bc52fbf.md#loiobc52fbf3d59447bbb6aa22f80d8b6056).
