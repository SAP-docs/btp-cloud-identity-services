# Configure X.509 Client Certificates for User Authentication

Tenant administrators can configure X.509 client certificates for user authentication as an alternative to authenticating with a user name and a password.



<a name="loio52c7dcb7bbb94f38ab75a4cc9a8cbe03__prereq_ofg_hzf_ppb"/>

## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

User authentication with a trusted X.509 certificate takes place using the underlying Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) protocol and users donâ€™t need to enter a password for their logon.

Certificates for API Authentication cannot be used for user authentication.

Remember that it may take between two and four weeks to enable the certificate.

> ### Note:  
> If you want to configure a certificate, using your own trusted CA, for example for scenarios like authentication of technical users or OAuth clients, skip the procedure in this document and report an incident on [SAP Support Portal Home](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html) with a component `BC-IAM-IDS`. Attach to the incident the root and intermediate certificates and provide the Identity Authentication tenant host.

> ### Caution:  
> If the users have generated their own certificates via the profile page, they won't be able to authenticate with the configured X.509 client certificate, and vice versa.



### Edit and Delete Certificates

If you want to edit an already configured certificate, choose certificate, choose the *Edit* button, make your changes and save them.

> ### Remember:  
> If you have made changes to the root certificate, report an incident on [SAP Support Portal Home](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html) with a component `BC-IAM-IDS`, attach to the incident the root and intermediate certificates, and provide the Identity Authentication tenant host.

If you want to delete an already configured certificate, choose the certificate, choose the *Delete* button, and report an incident on [SAP Support Portal Home](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html) with a component `BC-IAM-IDS` providing the Identity Authentication tenant host.

To configure a trusted X.509 certificate, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Tenant Settings* tile.

    At the top of the page, you can view the administrative and license relevant information of the tenant.

3.  Under *Authentication*, choose the *Trusted Certificate Configuration* list item.

4.  Choose the *Create* button.

5.  Enter the name of the certificate.

    > ### Note:  
    > The name and the *Subject DN* must be unique.

6.  Choose one of the following options:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Certificate Options
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Notes
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    **Upload Certificate**
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    The uploaded certificates must be in `PEM` format. Use `.cer` or `.crt` files.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    **Root Certificate**
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Insert the public key in the text field.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
7.  Choose one of the following source options:

    -   *Distinguished Name* - If selected *Distinguished Name* as source, the pattern must match the *Subject DN* of the user certificate. The *CN* attribute from the *DN Pattern* must be in the format `CN=${<logonIdentifier>}` and must completely map to one of the supported logon identifiers, `loginName`, `uid`, and `mail`.

        For example: CN=$\{loginName\},O=Management,C=US.

    -   *Subject Alternative Name - Other Name* - If selected *Subject Alternative Name - Other Name*, the pattern must match the `subjectAltName` extension entry of type `otherName` \(Microsoft User Principal Name form\) of the user certificate. The pattern for SAN value must be in format `${<logonIdentifier>}` and must completely map to one of the supported logon identifiers, `loginName`, `uid`, and `mail`.
    -   *Subject Alternative Name - Email \(RFC822 Name\)* - If selected *Subject Alternative Name - Email \(RFC822 Name\)*, the pattern must match the `subjectAltName` extension entry of type `rfc822Name` of the user certificate. The pattern for SAN value must be in format `${mail}`.

    Two configurations with different source options in one Identity Authentication tenant are not supported.

8.  Enter the *Pattern* of the certificate.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you want to log on with a certificate where the common name contains the user ID \(for example: `Subject DN: CN=P000000,O=MyOrg,C=US`\) then the pattern value must be: `CN=${uid},O=MyOrg,C=US`.
    > 
    > If you want to log on with a certificate where the common name contains the email of the user \(for example: `Subject DN: CN=my_email@example.com,O=MyORG,C=US`\), then the pattern value must be: `CN=${mail},O=M,C=US`.

9.  Save your configuration.

10. To add the certificate to your tenant, report an incident on [SAP Support Portal Home](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html) with a component `BC-IAM-IDS`. The SAP Cloud Root CA certificates are trusted by default.

    1.  Attach to the incident the root and intermediate certificates.

    2.  Provide the Identity Authentication tenant host.


    > ### Remember:  
    > The SAP Cloud Root CA, DigiCert Global Root CA, DigiCert Global Root G2, DigiCert TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1, and Baltimore CyberTrust Root certificates are trusted by default.
