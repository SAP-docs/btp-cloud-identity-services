# SCIM REST API \(Deprecated\) Authentication Mechanisms

See how to configure the authentication mechanisms for the [Identity Authentication API \(Deprecated\)](../Development/identity-authentication-api-deprecated-2f21568.md) methods of Identity Authentication.

To call the methods of this SCIM REST API you must have a system as administrator with an assigned *Manage Users* role. For more details about how to add a system as administrator and assign administrator roles, see [Add System as Administrator](add-administrators-bbbdbdd.md#loiocefb742a36754b18bbe5c3503ac6d87c), and [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).
