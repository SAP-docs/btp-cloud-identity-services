## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You have configured the application or the tenant to require two-factor authentication. For more information, see [Configure Risk-Based Authentication for an Application](configure-risk-based-authentication-for-an-application-bc52fbf.md#loiobc52fbf3d59447bbb6aa22f80d8b6056) or [Configure Default Risk-Based Authentication for All Applications in the Tenant](configure-default-risk-based-authentication-for-all-applications-in-the-tenant-1aab51a.md#loio1aab51ae62b94f79b4c6dac7a00857c2).




## Context

The number of days for which users can postpone the enabling of second factor can be set between 1 and 14 days. The configuration is valid for all applications in the tenant.

If the tenant or application requires two-factor authentication, and the users don't have an enabled two-factor authentication method, or the method that is enabled is not among the ones required by the application, at sign-in users can choose to skip the enabling of two-factor authentication for the period defined by the tenant administrator. The users can sign in without providing a second factor until the grace period expires.

Users can be notified for their choice, if the security alert notification is switched on. They receive a security alert email after they first skip the enabling of two-factor. For more information about how to configure the e-mail alerts, see [Send Security Alert Emails](send-security-alert-emails-c977464.md).
