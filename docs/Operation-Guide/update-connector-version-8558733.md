# Update Connector Version

Update a connector version to allow your provisioning system to use a new API.

When an SAP cloud solution or service provides a new API for integrating with Identity Provisioning, you can update your respective connector \(provisioning system\) to use this API by configuring a version property and replacing its transformations.

For example, SAP Sales Cloud and SAP Service Cloud \(formerly known as SAP Cloud for Customer\) initially provided two SOAP-based APIs for integrating with Identity Provisioning and later introduced a SCIM-based API. Likewise, Identity Authentication service initially provided a SCIM-based API and later introduced an Identity Directory SCIM API.

Version property set to `1` means that your connector is using the initial API. You can continue using it as-is or update your connector to a new version.

> ### Note:  
> Before updating your connector to a new version, it is always a good practice to export the system for backup purposes. See: [Export and Import Systems](export-and-import-systems-1de7de0.md)

To update your connector to use a new API, proceed as follows:



<a name="loio85587335f47441f4bbe0537d90304a3b__section_hn4_2wc_lxb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI and choose a tile â€“ *Source Systems*, *Target Systems*, or *Proxy Systems*.

    Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Source Systems*, *Target Systems* or *Proxy Systems*.

2.  From the list on the left, select a system.

3.  On the *Properties* tab, configure the following:

    1.  **Version Property** - Add or update the <code><i class="varname">&lt;system_prefix&gt;</i>.api.version</code> property and set its value accordingly.

4.  On the *Transformations* tab, if you've customized your transformation logic, copy and save it first, and then replace it with the default transformation provided for the respective API version. Use the Identity Provisioning connector documentation as a source of information for the transformation you need.

5.  [Reset the system](reset-identity-provisioning-system-0bc1e53.md) to clear the operational data. It is assumed that you have already run provisioning jobs to target systems.

    -   If you reset a target system, set the `ips.delete.existedbefore.entities` to **true** in the target system itself. This ensures that, if from now on you delete entities in the source system that is connected to your target system, those entities will be recognized as previously existed entities in the target system and will be deleted there.

    -   If you reset a source system, set the `ips.delete.existedbefore.entities` to **true** in every target system connected to the given source system. This ensures that, if from now on you delete entities in the source system that is connected to your target system, those entities will be recognized as previously existed entities in the target system and will be deleted there.


6.  Adapt your new transformation, that is, apply the customizations from your previous transformation.

7.  Save your changes and run a provisioning job.
