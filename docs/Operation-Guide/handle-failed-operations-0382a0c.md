# Handle Failed Operations

In certain cases, you can set a retry for a failed operation due to an occurred exception.

If an entity operation \(*get*, *create*, *update*, or *delete*\) fails due to an occurred exception \(rate limit, bad gateway, missing authorization, or timeout\), you can set it for retry by the Identity Provisioning. You can specify a number of retries by setting the property `ips.failed.request.retry.attempts`. You can also specify a time interval \(in seconds\) between the retries via the property `ips.failed.request.retry.attempts.interval`. For more information, see [List of Properties](../list-of-properties-d6f3577.md).

Based on the system you use, the type of failed operation, and the occurred exception, the option to retry is possible in the following cases:
