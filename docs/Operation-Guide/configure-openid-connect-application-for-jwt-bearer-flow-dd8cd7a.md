<a name="copydd8cd7ac2c6d49a29d21505fd9aca773__prereq_grq_3jn_v2b"/>

## Prerequisites

You have an OpenID Connect application in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. For more information, see [Create OpenID Connect Application](create-openid-connect-application-62fb1c3.md).

    > ### Tip:  
    > For more information about the format of the redirect URIs and post logout redirect URIs, see [OpenID Connect Application Configurations](openid-connect-application-configurations-1ae324e.md).

7.  **Optional:** \(If you added second signing certificate in tenant settings\) Under *Identity Provider Certificate*, choose the certificate to be used.

    > ### Tip:  
    > When the default identity provider certificate is changed with a new one, and the old one is not used anymore, we recommend you to delete the old certificate.

8.  Select the *JWT Bearer* grant type.

    > ### Note:  
    > Beware that for each flow the respective grant type must be selected. All other grant types can be deselected if they aren't required by the application.

9.  Save your selection. Once the application has been changed, the system displays the message ***Application <name of application\> updated***.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Configure trust on the client side. See the client documentation for more information about how to configure the trust.

## Next Steps

-   Configure HTTP basic authentication for the application. For more information about the configuration, see [Configure Secrets for API Authentication](configure-secrets-for-api-authentication-5c3c35e.md).

-   Enable the public client flows option for this application. In the administration console, choose *the OpenID connect application* \> *Client Authentication under the Trust tab* \> *Enable Public Client Flows under Public Client*. Optionally, you can configure the API permission groups. For more information, see [Consuming APIs from Other Applications](../Development/consuming-apis-from-other-applications-29e204d.md) .

    > ### Note:  
    > The *Public* client type is used for environments where it is difficult to protect the client credential, such as mobile and desktop applications, and client-side parts of web applications.
