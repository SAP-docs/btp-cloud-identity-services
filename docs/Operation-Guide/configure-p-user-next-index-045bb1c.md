# Configure P-User Next Index

Set the value for the P-user next index.



## Context

Every user in Identity Authentication has a `User ID` which is an automatically generated number preceded by the letter P. The first administrator, which is also the first user, receives the number P 000000. The`User ID` of every other user that is created in Identity Authentication is incremented by 1. Thus the second user has a `User ID` P 000001, and so on. You can change the P-number index by setting a new number from which the P-number to start. The new value must always be higher than the current one. For example, the User ID of the latest created user is P 000100, which means that the current P-user index is 100. If you want the of the next user to be P 000200,`User ID` then you should make the P-user index 200.

> ### Restriction:  
> Beware, that after the change is saved you won't be able to set the P-number index value to a number lower than the current one.
> 
> The P-number index can't be higher than 2147483647.



## Procedure

1.  Access the tenant's administration console for Identity Authentication by using the console's URL.

    > ### Note:  
    > The URL has the following pattern:
    > 
    > `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/admin`
    > 
    > *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation e-mail with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](../viewing-assigned-tenants-and-administrators-f56e6f2.md).
    > 
    > If you have a configured custom domain, the URL has the following pattern: `<your custom domain>/admin`.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Tenant Settings* tile.

    At the top of the page you can view the administrative and license relevant information of the tenant.

3.  Choose the *Tenant Default Values* list item.

4.  Enter a number for the *P-user next index*.

5.  Save your changes.
