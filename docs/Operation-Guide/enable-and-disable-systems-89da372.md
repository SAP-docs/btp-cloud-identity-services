# Enable and Disable Systems

You can enable and disable source and target systems in Identity Provisioning.



## Context

To use a system for provisioning purposes, its status has to be **Enabled**. When you add a new system, it is enabled by default. If one of your added systems is configured and you currently do not need it, but would like to use it later, you can disable it.



## Procedure

1.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI and choose a tile â€“ *Source Systems*, *Target Systems*, or *Proxy Systems*.

2.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Source Systems*, *Target Systems* or *Proxy Systems*.

3.  From the list on the left, select a system.

4.  At the top right corner of your screen, choose one of the following options:

    -   If the system is currently disabled, choose the *Enable* button and confirm the action.
    -   If the system is currently enabled, choose the *Disable* button and confirm the action.

5.  Save your changes.
