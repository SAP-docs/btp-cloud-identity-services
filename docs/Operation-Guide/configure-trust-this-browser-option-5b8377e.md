# Configure *Trust this browser* Option

Tenant administrator can set the number of days for which the users won't get prompted for second-factor authentication, if they sign in from the same browser.



<a name="loio5b8377e3a80941bfa3b475a0c715be43__prereq_v3j_xzf_ppb"/>

## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

The validity of *Trust this browser* can be set between 1 and 14 days.

If the option for trust this browser is set at *Disabled*, and a user chooses to always provide second factor when authenticating, the validity of *Trust this browser* is 3 months. But if the administrator sets a validity from 1 to 14 days, the 3-month validity is overridden with the validity set by the tenant administrator.

The *Trust this browser* checkbox appears at sign-in when a second factor is required for the users. When users chose the *Trust this browser* checkbox, the second factor is required only with the first sign-in. The validity depends on the configuration in the administration console.

> ### Note:  
> If the device for time-based one-time password \(TOTP\) or Web Two-Factor Authentication is deactivated, all the related tokens for the user will be removed.



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Tenant Settings* tile.

    At the top of the page, you can view the administrative and license relevant information of the tenant.

3.  Under *Authentication*, choose the *Multi-Factor Authentication* list item.

4.  Manually configure the trust this browser option under *Additional Settings for Multi-Factor Authentication*.

    If the operation is successful, the system displays the message ***Additional Multi-Factor Authentication Settings updated***.
