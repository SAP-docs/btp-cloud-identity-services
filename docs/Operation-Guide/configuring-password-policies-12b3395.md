# Configuring Password Policies

Passwords for the authentication of users are subject to certain rules. These rules are defined in the password policy. Identity Authentication provides you with two predefined password policies, in addition to which you can create and configure up to three custom password policies.



You have the following options for a password policy:

-   Standard

    \(Predefined\) Use this option to set special rules for changing, resetting, and locking a password.

    > ### Note:  
    > This is the default setting. It meets the minimum strength requirements.

-   Enterprise

    \(Predefined\) Use this option to set enhanced password management features. It’s stronger than the standard policy, but weaker than the custom one.

-   Custom

    \(Configurable\) Use this option to set the strongest password management features for the password policy. It's the responsibility of the tenant administrator to configure the custom password policy stronger than the standard and enterprise ones.

    > ### Remember:  
    > This option is only possible if you’ve configured a custom password policy in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. For more information, see [Configure Custom Password Policy](configure-custom-password-policy-67bece2.md).
