# Base Authorization Policies

Base authorization policies are delivered with the respective application.



In the administration console, administrators can use them to create their own refined custom authorization policies, which they assign to users. We recommend that application developers define the base policies with the basic authorizations that are required for the specific application. For more information, see [Configuring Authorization Policies](configuring-authorization-policies-982ac5f.md).

> ### Note:  
> Currently, the administration console doesn't support the creation of tenant-specific base policies.
