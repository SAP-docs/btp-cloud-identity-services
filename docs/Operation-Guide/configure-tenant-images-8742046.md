<a name="loio8742046ee4604bb6b3907beb5c6d9254__prereq_mxs_lzf_ppb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   \(for the background image only\) - You use the *Horizon* theme for your application. For more information, see [Choose and Configure a Branding Style for an Application](choose-and-configure-a-branding-style-for-an-application-32f8d33.md).

## Context



### Logo

The logo is displayed in the footer or header of the form that your users access to sign in or to register to an application. If you don't specify a company-specific tenant logo, the forms display the default SAP logo. SAP has configured the following default tenant logo.

![](images/Default_tenant_logo_6170d47.png)

You can use an image with a maximum height of 36 pixels.

> ### Note:  
> If the height of the image is larger than 36 pixels, the user forms show the logo proportionally resized to a height of 36 pixels. Thus, the quality will be preserved.
> 
> If the height of the image is lower than 36 pixels, the user forms resize the image. Otherwise, the quality is deteriorated.

The image file must have one of the following extensions: `.png`, `.gif`, `.jpeg`, or `svg`.

> ### Caution:  
> If the image is of format <svg\>, please make sure that the attribute `viewBox = "min-x min-y width height"` is present. For proper rendering the width and height values must not exceed 100. For example, `viewBox="0 0 100 100"`



### Background Image

> ### Note:  
> The background image is applied only to applications that use the *Horizon* theme. For more information about the *Horizon* theme, see [Choose and Configure a Branding Style for an Application](choose-and-configure-a-branding-style-for-an-application-32f8d33.md).

The background image is displayed behind the form that your users access to sign in or to register to an application.

![](images/Background_Image_c6f2dff.png)

If you do not specify a background image, the forms won't display anything.

The image file must have one of the following extensions: `.png`, or `.jpg`.

You can use an image with a maximum size of 600 KB \(1920x1080 pixels\)

> ### Remember:  
> The background image option is limited to mobile devices with minimum height of 599 pixels.

Identity Authentication doesn't store old versions the image. Once you upload a new image, the previous image is deleted.



### Favicon

Favicon is a shortcut icon in a browser's address bar, for browsers that support them. Browsers that provide favicon support typically display the favicon for a page in the browser's address bar and next to the page title on the tab. Browsers that support a tabbed document interface typically show a favicon for a page next to the page title on the tab. You can upload a file for a custom favicon of Identity Authentication.

The image file must have one of the following extensions: `.png`, or `.jpg` with a maximum size of 100 KB \(max 100x100 pixels\).

To configure a custom tenant logo a background image, and or a favicon, follow procedure below. It takes up to 2 minutes for the configuration changes to take place.
