# Configure Identity Authentication for Real-Time Provisioning

Enable real-time provisioning in Identity Authentication to trigger immediate synchronization of user changes to target systems configured in Identity Provisioning.



<a name="loio334964514e8b48cb88c8ed07f5ee6a14__prereq_f1p_whv_cbc"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have created a technical user for accessing the real-time provisioning API and assigned it the *Access Real-Time Provisioning API* permission. This user must be an administrator of type *System*. You have also configured *Secret* for the technical user.

    For more information, see [Add System as Administrator](add-administrators-bbbdbdd.md#loiocefb742a36754b18bbe5c3503ac6d87c).

    For OAuth authentication scenario for tenants running on Neo environmen, you've made the required configurations in the SAP BTP cockpit. For more information, see [Create OAuth Client Credentials in SAP BTP Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-provisioning/identity-provisioning/real-time-provisioning-in-neo-environment?version=Cloud#i.-create-oauth-client-credentials-in-sap-btp-cockpit).

-   You have created Identity Authentication source system in Identity Provisioning and connected it to target systems of your choice.

    For more information, see [Identity Authentication](../identity-authentication-e4e25f1.md) and [Target Systems](../target-systems-ab3f641.md).




## Context

In this scenario you configure Identity Provisioning as a target system in Identity Authentication real-time configuration, and Identity Authentication as a source system in Identity Provisioning. As a result, when users are created, updated or deleted in Identity Authentication, the changes will be immediately provisioned to the target systems configured in Identity Provisioning.

Real-time provisioning is applicable for users that have been manually created or updated in Identity Authentication, using SCIM API \(version 1 or 2\), or via CSV file upload. It is not applicable for users updated by a provisioning job.

> ### Caution:  
> Users coming from a source \(system A\) which are created or updated in Identity Authentication target \(system B\) using a provisioning job, **cannot** be later synchronized from Identity Authentication to another target \(system C\) using real-time provisioning. This is a precaution behavior, preventing any data collisions if you later decide to run a provisioning job for the same systems: Identity Authentication source \(system B\) and target \(system C\). See the example below.

> ### Example:  
> 1.  You enable real-time provisioning for Identity Authentication and configure it as a source system that points to SAP Marketing Cloud target system.
> 
>     As a result, Identity Authentication users are immediately provisioned to SAP Marketing Cloud.
> 
> 2.  You configure Microsoft Active Directory as a source system that points to Identity Authentication target system and run a provisioning job.
> 
>     As a result, Microsoft Active Directory users are provisioned to Identity Authentication. Even though new users are created in Identity Authentication, they are not provisioned further to SAP Marketing Cloud by real-time provisioning.

> ### Tip:  
> If you want to provision groups in real time, you need to use a REST client for initiating POST and DELETE requests to the Real-time provisioning API: <code>https://<i class="varname">&lt;tenantId&gt;</i>.<i class="varname">&lt;host&gt;</i>/ipsproxy/service/api/v1/systems/<i class="varname">&lt;system-id&gt;</i>/entities/group</code>.

To configure real-time provisioning in Identity Authentication to trigger immediate synchronization of user changes to target systems configured in Identity Provisioning follow the procedure below:



<a name="loio334964514e8b48cb88c8ed07f5ee6a14__steps_esh_zdb_vhb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Users & Authorizations*, choose the *Real-Time Provisioning* tile.

    This operation opens a list of the target systems.

3.  Choose the *\+Add* button to add a new target system and provide the following information:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    New System
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Field
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Value
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top" rowspan="4">
    
    *Target Configurations* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Display Name* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Provide a name for the target system. It can be identical with the source system you have created in Identity Provisioning.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Type* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    From the dropdown, select *Identity Provisioning*.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *SCIM URL* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Provide the SCIM URL in the following pattern:

    <code>https://<i class="varname">&lt;ias-tenant-host&gt;</i>/ipsproxy/service/api/v1/systems/<i class="varname">&lt;system-id&gt;</i>/entities/user</code>

    The *<system-id\>* is the ID of the *Identity Authentication* source system you have added in Identity Provisioning. It is displayed at the end of the system URL.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Version*

    -   *1*

    -   *2*



    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Defines the version of Identity Authentication SCIM API.

    *1* - the Identity Authentication SCIM API \(in short, SCIM API version 1\) is used.

    *2* - the Identity Directory SCIM API \(in short, SCIM API version 2\) is used.

    > ### Note:  
    > The version that you specify here must be the same as the version of the `ias.api.version` property in Identity Authentication source system.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top" rowspan="3">
    
    *Authentication Mechanism* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *OAuth* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    For tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure, use the **user ID** and **password** of the Identity Authentication technical user. Provide an OAuth token URL following the pattern: <code>https://<i class="varname">&lt;ias-tenant-host&gt;</i>/oauth2/token</code> 

    > ### Note:  
    > OAuth authentication is only supported when calling the Real-Time Provisioning API. It cannot be configured in the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services.

    For more information for tenants running on Neo environment, see [Create OAuth Client Credentials in SAP BTP Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-provisioning/identity-provisioning/real-time-provisioning-in-neo-environment?version=Cloud#i.-create-oauth-client-credentials-in-sap-btp-cockpit).
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Basic* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    If you choose this option, provide the following information:

    In the *Username* field, enter the client ID of the technical user.

    In the *Password* field, enter the client secret of the technical user.

    For more information, see *step 6* in [Add System as Administrator](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/add-administrators?version=Cloud#loiocefb742a36754b18bbe5c3503ac6d87c).
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Certificate* 
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    If you choose this option, proceed as follows:

    1.  Provide a common name and a password.

    2.  Generate and download the certificate.

    3.  Import it in the *Configure System Authentication* screen of the technical user for real-time provisioning, as described in *step 6* in [Add System as Administrator](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/add-administrators?version=Cloud#loiocefb742a36754b18bbe5c3503ac6d87c).


    The maximum length of the CN is 64 characters. Once the certificate is generated, it is saved as a `.crt` file. The common name is in the format *<common name\>*\(*<admin user ID\>*\), where common name is the CN provided by the administrator, and admin user ID is the administrator's user id.

    Identity Authentication supports SAP Passport CA as trusted certificate authority \(CA\).
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
4.  Save your changes.

    If the operation is successful, the system displays the message: ***Target system <name of system\> created***.

5.  **Optional:** Choose *Test Connection* before executing the provisioning.

    If the setup is correct, the following message is displayed: ***Connection to the selected target system was established successfully.***

6.  Choose *Provision*.
