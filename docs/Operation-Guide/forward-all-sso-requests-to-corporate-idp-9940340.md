## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Corporate Identity Providers* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You have configured Identity Authentication to use a corporate identity provider as an external authenticating authority. For more information, see [Configure Trust with SAML 2.0 Corporate Identity Provider](configure-trust-with-saml-2-0-corporate-identity-provider-33832e5.md) or [Forward All SSO Requests to Corporate IdP](forward-all-sso-requests-to-corporate-idp-9940340.md).

## Context

The *Forward All SSO Requests to Corporate IdP* option allows the corporate identity provider \(IdP\) to process all single sign-on \(SSO\) requests when Identity Authentication acts as a proxy.

By default, the *Forward All SSO Requests to Corporate IdP* option is disabled. In this case Identity Authentication reuses the active session of the user.

When *Forward All SSO Requests to Corporate IdP* option is enabled, Identity Authentication sends new authentication request for each application.
