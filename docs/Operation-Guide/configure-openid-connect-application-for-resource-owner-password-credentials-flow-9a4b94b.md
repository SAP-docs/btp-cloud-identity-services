## Prerequisites

You have an OpenID Connect application in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. For more information, see [Create OpenID Connect Application](create-openid-connect-application-62fb1c3.md).



## Context

The trust is configured by entering the information manually. You can enter manually the name of the client \(relying party\).

To configure an OpenID Connect trusted application in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services, proceed as follows:

## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Trust* tab.

5.  Under *SINGLE SIGN-ON*, choose *OpenID Connect Configuration*.

6.  Under the *Configure Manually* section provide a name of your choice.

7.  **Optional:** \(If you added second signing certificate in tenant settings\) Under *Identity Provider Certificate*, choose the certificate to be used.

    > ### Tip:  
    > When the default identity provider certificate is changed with a new one, and the old one is not used anymore, we recommend you to delete the old certificate.

8.  Select the *Password*

    > ### Note:  
    > Beware that for each flow the respective grant type must be selected. All other grant types can be deselected if they aren't required by the application.

9.  Save your selection. Once the application has been changed, the system displays the message ***Application <name of application\> updated***.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Configure trust on the client side. See the client documentation for more information about how to configure the trust.

## Next Steps

-   Configure HTTP basic authentication for the application. For more information about the configuration, see [Configure Secrets for API Authentication](configure-secrets-for-api-authentication-5c3c35e.md).

-   Enable the public client flows option for this application. In the administration console, choose *the OpenID connect application* \> *Client Authentication under the Trust tab* \> *Enable Public Client Flows under Public Client*. Optionally, you can configure the API permission groups. For more information, see [Consuming APIs from Other Applications](../Development/consuming-apis-from-other-applications-29e204d.md) .

    > ### Note:  
    > The *Public* client type is used for environments where it is difficult to protect the client credential, such as mobile and desktop applications, and client-side parts of web applications.
