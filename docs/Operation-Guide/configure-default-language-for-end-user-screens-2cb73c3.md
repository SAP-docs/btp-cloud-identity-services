# Configure Default Language for End User Screens

Select the language that the end user screen uses if the language of the browser isnâ€™t in the list of supported languages.



## Context

The end user screens of the applications that use Cloud Identity Services for authentication, support the following languages: Arabic \(ar\), Bulgarian \(bg\), Catalan \(ca\), Chinese PRC \(zh-cn\), Chinese Taiwan \(zh-tw\), Croatian \(hr\), Czech \(cs\), Danish \(da\), Dutch \(nl\), English United Kingdom \(en-gb\), English United States \(en-us\), Estonian \(et\), Finnish \(fi\), French Standard \(fr\), French Canada \(fr-ca\), German Standard \(de\), Greek \(el\), Hebrew \(iw\), Hungarian \(hu\), Italian \(it\), Japanese \(ja\), Korean \(ko\), Latvian \(lv\), Lithuanian \(lt\), Malay \(s\), Norwegian \(no\), Polish \(pl\), Portuguese Portugal \(pt\), Romanian \(ro\), Russian \(ru\), Serbian \(sr\), Slovak \(sk\), Slovenian \(sl\), Spanish \(es\), Spanish Mexico \(es-mx\), Swedish \(sv\), Thai \(th\), Turkish \(tr\), Ukrainian \(uk\), Vietnamese \(vi\), Welsh \(cy\).

The language for the end user screens is set according to the following order of priorities:

1.  If the locale is set, the end user screen uses the language set there.

    Setting the locale, sets an Identity Authentication cookie. This cookie is used for all the applications in this session that are configured to use Identity Authentication as identity provider.

    > ### Note:  
    > The locale can be set in either of the following ways:
    > 
    > -   The locale is communicated to Identity Authentication by adding a locale parameter to *SAP\_IDS.js*.
    > 
    >     > ### Source Code:  
    > 
    >     `<script src="https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/ui/resources/javascripts/SAP_IDS.js?locale=en_GB" />` 
    > 
    > -   The locale is communicated to Identity Authentication by a direct `GET` request.
    > 
    >     > ### Source Code:  
    > 
    >     `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/ui/public/setLocale?locale=DE`

2.  If the locale is not set, the end user screen uses the language that the user's browser is set to.

    -   If the locale is in the list of supported locales, the end user screen uses this locale's configurations.

    -   If the locale is not among the supported locales, Identity Authentication looks for configuration from the language part of the locale. For example if there is a request with `en_CA`, as it is not supported, Identity Authentication looks for configurations with `en`.

    -   If the language is not in the list of supported languages, the end user screen uses the language set by the tenant administrator. The choice is from the list of the supported languages. If no configuration is done, the end user screen uses *English United States* language, which is the default value.



> ### Remember:  
> It takes 2 minutes for the configuration changes to take place.
