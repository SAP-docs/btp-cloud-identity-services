# Corporate User Store

If you have an existing on-premise user store, you can configure Identity Authentication to use the corporate user store in addition to its own cloud user store.

Th–µ integration between Identity Authentication and the corporate user store allows users to authenticate with their corporate credentials from the corporate user store, without the need to use another set of credentials for their cloud access.

You can have two configurations, depending on the SAP BTP environment, you are using:

-   [Corporate User Store \(Cloud Foundry Environment\)](corporate-user-store-cloud-foundry-environment-9942ede.md#loio9942ede4fae84934a8eb184a0015c305)

    Recommended.

-   [Corporate User Store \(Neo Environment\)](corporate-user-store-neo-environment-461d71c.md#loio461d71c148594608b9c8b6d016e0a0c5)

    Recommended if you are using SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA, with the following variants:

    -   SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA - UME

    -   SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA - UME

    -   Multiple Active Directories connected to SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA - UME
