# Reset Identity Provisioning System

Resetting an Identity Provisioning system \(source or target\) deletes all Identity Provisioning operational data.



## Context

There might be times when you would like to delete the current Identity Provisioning operational data for a particular system. For example, clearing entities that were read from the source system and were then mapped to SCIM specific attributes via the intermediate transformation logic.

This operation is called *system reset*. If you choose it, you only clear the Identity Provisioning operational data. The system configurations and all existing read and provisioned entities, along with their authorizations, will be preserved in the back-end source and target systems. To learn more, see: [Transformations](../transformations-81f5204.md) 

Cases that require reset of the provisioning system are:

-   Updating the version of the provisioning source or target system; For more information, see [Update Connector Version](update-connector-version-8558733.md).
-   Changing the attribute mapped to the variable *entityIdSourceSystem* \(for a source system\) or *entityIdTargetSystem* \(for a target system\); For more information, see [Transformation Variables](../transformation-variables-8376adb.md).
-   Resetting Identity Authentication target system might be needed after an SAP SuccessFactors instance refresh. For more information, see SAP Note [2954491](https://me.sap.com/notes/2954491).
-   Database restore of the back-end target system \(for example, Identity Authentication\). After restoring a previously saved state of the database, some data or configurations might be out of sync. Itâ€™s recommended that you reset the system before running a provisioning job.

In all other cases, reset is not required, nor recommended. If you have any concerns, report an incident on [SAP Support Portal Home](https://help.sap.com/docs/link-disclaimer?site=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.sap.com%2Fen%2Findex.html) for the *BC-IAM-IPS* component.

If you want to reset your system, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Bundle Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/7ab5884ffbc44461a57622d2f633e57c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning UI when the service is bundled as part of an SAP cloud solution's license.") :arrow_upper_right:
    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

2.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Source Systems* or *Target Systems*

3.  Select the relevant source or target system.

    > ### Restriction:  
    > This *reset* operation is not applicable to proxy systems.

4.  At the top right corner of your screen, choose the *Reset* button and confirm the action.

## Next Steps

Regardless of the type of system you have reset - source or target ones, continue with the following steps:

1.  Start a provisioning job. See: [Start and Stop Provisioning Jobs](start-and-stop-provisioning-jobs-531a261.md)

2.  Set the `ips.delete.existedbefore.entities` to **true** on all affected target systems. This ensures that, if from now on you delete entities in the source system, those entities will be recognized as previously existed entities in the target systems and will be deleted there.

3.  Start a provisioning job again.


> ### Note:  
> Following a reset, scheduled jobs preserve their defined time period.
