# Using Token Exchange

To authenticate using the Token Exchange flow, follow the procedures below. Tasks 1 and 2 are configurations on Identity Authentication side. Task 3 is a configuration, done on the client \(relying party\) side.

The Token Exchange is used, as the name states, for token exchanges. For more information about this flow, see the [OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693) specification.
