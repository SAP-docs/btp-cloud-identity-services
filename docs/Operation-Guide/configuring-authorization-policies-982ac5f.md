# Configuring Authorization Policies

Authorization management enables SAP Cloud Identity Services administrators to use authorization policies, customize them, and assign them to users.

When you subscribe to an application that supports authorization policies, you get a corresponding application in *Applications*, and from there you can assign authorizations.

For more information, see [Subscribe to Multitenant Applications Using the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/7a3e39622be14413b2a4df7c02ca1170.html), [Assign Authorization Policies](assign-authorization-policies-eac8e5e.md), and [Add Users to a Group](add-users-to-a-group-d2e1a01.md).

## Prerequisites

-   Your application supports authorization policies. Refer to the documentation of your application.

-   Your user has administrative permissions in SAP Cloud Identity Services with the following authorizations:

    -   *Manage Applications*

    -   *Manage Groups*

    -   *Read Users*


    For more information, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You are using SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication. For more information, see [Tenants](../tenants-93160eb.md).


> ### Note:  
> If your application doesn't have an *Authorization Policies* tab, it doesn't support authorization management.

## Authorization Management

Authorization management allows SAP Cloud Identity Services administrators to refine authorization policies based on application policy templates with powerful instance restrictions for data access. Developers define and deploy authorization policies with functional checks, instance-based authorizations, and user attributes. They're available in the SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console. If necessary, developers can update existing authorization policies.

For more information, see [Developing Authorizations](../Development/developing-authorizations-22928a2.md).

## Authorization Policy Types

An authorization policy is basically a collection of rules, which are applied to resources and restricted by conditions. Authorization policies are defined by developers and come with the respective application.

We distinguish between different types of authorization policies. You recognize the different types in the *Package* column.

-   The package name of the base policies is defined by the application.

-   Customers can deploy their own authorization policies in customer-developed packages, which have the package name *Customer Package* in the list of authorization policies.

Custom authorization policy

Authorization policy created by administrators. You can change and delete this authorization policy in the administration console.

> ### Restriction:  
> To make sure that authorization management is resilient, we've introduced an upper limit of 200 custom authorization policies and 200 base authorization policies that can be defined per application.

## Configuration Options

Authorization policy administrators can configure the following in custom authorization policies:

-   Combine authorization policies. See [Combine Authorization Policies](combine-authorization-policies-1a69414.md).

-   Add or delete rules and restrictions and their attribute values. See [Edit an Authorization Policy](edit-an-authorization-policy-c76aca6.md).
