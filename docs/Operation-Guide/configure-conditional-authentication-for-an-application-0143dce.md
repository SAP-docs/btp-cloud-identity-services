# Configure Conditional Authentication for an Application

Tenant administrator can define rules for authenticating identity provider according to email domain, user type, user group, and IP range \(specified in CIDR notation\).

## Context

Tenant administrator can control the access to an application by defining different rules for the authenticating identity provider. Based on these rules users are authenticated either via a corporate identity provider or via Identity Authentication.

**Rules**

The added rules are displayed sorted by priority.

If a rule contains only *IP Range*, and it is first in list or only one, Identity Authentication does not request the user to provide user identifier in the logon screen. The system evaluates whether that user meets all the criteria of the rule. The evaluation starts with the rule with the highest priority, until the criteria of a rule are met. If the criteria of a rule are met, the rest of the conditions are not evaluated

If apart from *IP Range* the rule contains other conditions, or it is not the first in the list, Identity Authentication requests the user to provide user identifier in the logon screen. When a user types the user identifier in the log on page, the system evaluates whether that user meets all the criteria of the rule. The evaluation starts with the rule with the highest priority, until the criteria of a rule are met. If the criteria of a rule are met, the rest of the conditions are not evaluated.

> ### Remember:  
> Rules can be defined only if the default identity provider is Identity Authentication.
> 
> If you have already defined rules, they won't be considered if you change the default identity provider from Identity Authentication to a corporate identity provider.

> ### Note:  
> If the user is already existing in Identity Authentication, authentication requests via SPNEGO, existing session, remember me, and token will be processed by Identity Authentication in case of successful authentication no matter of the conditional authentication rules. However, when the tenant has trusted certificate configuration, the application is SAML 2.0 type, and a conditional rule is configured, authentication is done by the local identity provider \(IdP\) with the certificate, except for the scenario when the conditional rule has an IP Range defined. In this case, if the rule matches, the user will be sent for authentication to the IdP from the rule.

**Default Identity Provider**

If non-prompt based authentication \(SPNEGO, existing session, remember me, and token\) is successful, the user is authenticated without checking the rules via Identity Authentication. Otherwise, the user will be asked to provide identifier to evaluate the conditional authentication rules.

If none of the rules meets the criteria, Identity Authentication is chosen for authentication.



### Conditional Authentication Flow

The tenant administrator has configured Conditional Authentication in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. In this setup, the employee should be authenticated via the corporate identity provider, while the customers via Identity Authentication.

**Authentication via Corporate Identity Provider** 

![](images/Conditional_Authentication_Corporate_IdP_e81d365.png)

1.  The user tries to access the application.
2.  The application redirects the request to Identity Authentication to check the rules.
3.  Identity Authentication requests the user to provide user identifier in the logon screen.

    > ### Remember:  
    > If the rule contains only *IP Range* Identity Authentication does not request the user to provide user identifier in the logon screen. This step is skipped for this scenario.
    > 
    > If apart from *IP Range* the rule contains other conditions, this step is executed.

4.  The user provides user identifier. Identity Authentication stores the user identifier in a persistent cookie in the browser. The persistent cookie expires in 36 months.

    > ### Remember:  
    > If the rule contains only *IP Range* Identity Authentication does not request the user to provide user identifier in the logon screen. This step is skipped for this scenario.
    > 
    > If apart from *IP Range* the rule contains other conditions, this step is executed.

5.  According to the rules, the user should be authenticated via the corporate identity provider. Identity Authentication sends the user identifier as `login_hint` parameter to the corporate identity provider in the authentication request, according to the *Login Hint Configuration* configuration in the administration console.

    > ### Note:  
    > The `login_hint` parameter helps the user when he or she is known to the service provider \(SP\). Thus it prevents the user from re-typing the user identifier on the logon or conditional screen.

    > ### Remember:  
    > The user identifier from step 3 is required at the first logon. After that, based on the persistent cookie, the user is redirected directly to the logon screen of the corporate identity provider.
    > 
    > If the user wants to log on with another identifier, he or she must delete the browser cookies.
    > 
    > When the persistent cookie expires, the user is again requested to provide user identifier in the logon screen.

6.  If the corporate identity provider supports the `login_hint` parameter, then it requests only the user password. If the corporate identity provider does not support the `login_hint` parameter, it requires both the user identifier and password.
7.  Depending on the support of the `login_hint`, user provides only password, or both user identifier and password.

    > ### Note:  
    > The user can change the prefilled value. The new value is sent to the corporate IdP. If there is an existing conditional authentication cookie, the user identifier stored in that cookie is prefilled on the conditional screen and the `login_hint` is not taken into account.

8.  The corporate identity provider grants access to the user.

**Result** 

The user logs on to the application.

**Authentication via Identity Authentication** 

![](images/Conditional_Authentication_Local_IdP_b957837.png)

1.  The user tries to access the application.
2.  The application redirects the request to Identity Authentication to check the rules.
3.  Identity Authentication request the user to provide user identifier in the log on screen.

    > ### Remember:  
    > If the rule contains only *IP Range* Identity Authentication does not request the user to provide user identifier in the logon screen. This step is skipped for this scenario.
    > 
    > If apart from *IP Range* the rule contains other conditions, this step is executed.

4.  The user provides user identifier.

    > ### Remember:  
    > If the rule contains only *IP Range* Identity Authentication does not request the user to provide user identifier in the logon screen. This step is skipped for this scenario.
    > 
    > If apart from *IP Range* the rule contains other conditions, this step is executed.

5.  According to the rules, the user should be authenticated via Identity Authentication. The user is prompted to provide password. The user identifier is prefilled in the logon screen.
6.  User provides password.
7.  Identity Authentication grants access to the user.

**Result** 

The user logs on to the application

> ### Note:  
> Social sign-on and account linking is supported only when the user does not meet the configured rules for conditional authentication.

## Setting Conditional Authentication

Donna Moore is an administrator of Company A. She wants to configure Identity Authentication so that the employees who log on with their corporate emails to be authenticated via the company's corporate identity provider. The clients and partners of Company A should be authenticated via Identity Authentication. For this purpose, Donna creates the following authentication rule:

**Authentication Rule**


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

</td>
<td valign="top">



</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Default Identity Provider**: Identity Authentication

Michael Adams is an employee of Company A and as such he wants to create a leave request. He chooses the logon link on the application and is prompted to provide his email. After that he chooses *Continue* and is redirected to the logon screen of Company A. There he has to provide his user identifier and password. After providing the correct credentials he logs on to the application.

Julie Armstrong is a customer of Company A. She accesses the company's application and chooses the logon link on the application and is prompted to provide her email. After that she chooses *Continue* and is redirected to the log on screen of Identity Authentication where she is prompted to provide her password. Her email is prefilled by the system. After providing the correct password she logs on to the application.
