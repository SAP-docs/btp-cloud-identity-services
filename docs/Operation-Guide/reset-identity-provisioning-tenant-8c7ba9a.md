# Reset Identity Provisioning Tenant

Resetting your Identity Provisioning tenant deletes all systems you have set up for this tenant \(subaccount\), along with the relevant job execution logs.



## Context

Be careful with this option. If you reset your Identity Provisioning tenant, you will lose all systems, configurations, scheduled jobs, source system subscriptions, and all job execution logs. If you want to use the service again afterward, you will have to set up new systems.

> ### Tip:  
> If you have a bundle account, all generated OAuth client credentials, as well as the admin users authorized for your Identity Provisioning system will be **kept**.

If want to reset your tenant, proceed as follows.
