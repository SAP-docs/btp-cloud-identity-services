## Context

Sinch service enables multichannel two-factor authentication \(2FA\), adding another layer of security to customers' online accounts, beyond their login and password. The service enables you to configure tokens – such as one-time passwords \(OTPs\), personal identification numbers \(PINs\), and verification codes – that are tailored to businesses and particular use cases.

For the integration between Identity Authentication and Sinch service, you must provide information in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. You can have a Sinch Verification configuration. You can clear the fields by choosing the *Remove Configuration* button at the top of the screen.

Provide the following:
