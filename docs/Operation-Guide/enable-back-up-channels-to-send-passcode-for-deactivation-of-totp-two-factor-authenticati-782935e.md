# Enable Back-Up Channels to Send Passcode for Deactivation of TOTP Two-Factor Authentication Devices

Tenant administrator can configure back-up channels to send TOTP deactivation passcodes to the user.



<a name="loio782935ec3c904178837e96043f2bbc6f__prereq_lrj_kvs_rjb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   \(for the SMS channel\) The user must have a verified phone.

-   \(for the SMS channel\) You have configured the Sinch Service option in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. For more information, see [Configure Sinch Service in Administration Console](configure-sinch-service-in-administration-console-f4a04ed.md).

-   \(for the email channel\) The user must have a verified email address.

-   \(for the email channel\) You have configured an email template for the *Deactivate TOTP Device* process. For more information, see [Configuring Email Templates](configuring-email-templates-b2afbcd.md).

    > ### Remember:  
    > The *$\{other.totpResetPasscode\}* parameter is mandatory for the *Deactivate TOTP Device* template.




## Context

The primary channel to deactivate a device is the passcode generated by the mobile device. If no other back-up channel is enabled, this option is the only one for the user in the *Two-Factor Authentication* section of the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

When the back-up channels, *SMS* and/or *Email* are enabled in the administration console, the user can choose from the options on the profile page: *Existing Multi-Factor Authentication*, *Passcode by SMS*, and *Passcode by Email*.

> ### Tip:  
> We recommend you to enable the back-up channels. Thus the users can use the option as an alternative when they don't have access to the TOTP device or application.

> ### Remember:  
> It takes 2 minutes for the configuration changes to take place.

To enable or disable back-up channels for deactivation passcode, follow the procedure below:



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Tenant Settings* tile.

    At the top of the page, you can view the administrative and license relevant information of the tenant.

3.  Under *Authentication*, choose the *Multi-Factor Authentication* list item.

4.  Under *TOTP Deactivation Passcode Channels Configuration*, enable or disable the options according to your needs.

    -   *SMS*
    -   *Email*

    If the operation is successful, the system displays the message ***TOTP Deactivation Options updated***.
