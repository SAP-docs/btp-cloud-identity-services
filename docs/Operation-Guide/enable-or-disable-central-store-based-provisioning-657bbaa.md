## Context

When you enable the *Central Store-Based Provisioning* for a specific application, whenever you update an application-specific group associated with this application, a provisioning of the updates is triggered from the Local Identity Directory to a target system of your choice. There is no need to run manual or scheduled jobs in the Identity Provisioning.



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Under the *Provisioning* tab, enable or disable the *Central Store-Based Provisioning* option.

    Once the application has been updated, the system displays the message ***Application <name of application\> updated***.
