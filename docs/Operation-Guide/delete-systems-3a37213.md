# Delete Systems

You can delete a source, target, or proxy system from Identity Provisioning.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> Before you delete a system, make sure you don't need it anymore. If you think you might need it in future, export it first as a JSON or a CSV file. To learn how, see: [Export and Import Systems](export-and-import-systems-1de7de0.md)

To delete a system, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI and choose a tile â€“ *Source Systems*, *Target Systems*, or *Proxy Systems*.

2.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Source Systems*, *Target Systems* or *Proxy Systems*.

3.  From the list on the left, select a system.

4.  At the top right corner of your screen, choose the *Delete* button and confirm the action.

5.  Save your changes.
