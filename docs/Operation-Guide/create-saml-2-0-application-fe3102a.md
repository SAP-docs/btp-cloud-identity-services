    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    *Parent Application*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Optional.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Newly created applications with an assigned parent application will inherit all the configurations from the parent except for the `Client ID` and `Secrets`. The inherited configurations will be marked as such.


    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Protocol Type*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">

    </table>
