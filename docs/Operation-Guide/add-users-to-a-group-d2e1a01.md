# Add Users to a Group

As a tenant administrator, you can add one or more users created for a specific tenant to a group via the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.



## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Groups* and *Manage Users* roles. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You have groups created in your tenant.




## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Choose the *Groups* tile.

    This operation opens a list of the groups in the tenant.

3.  Choose a group from the list on the left.

    This will show the group details and the users that are added to that group.

4.  Press the *Add* button.

5.  Add users to the group. You have the following options:

    -   Select users from the list.
    -   Search for the users.
        -   *starts with* - \(default/reccomended operator\) returns only users that start with the entered value.

        -   *contains* - retuns all the users that contain the entered value. Using the *contains* operator may result in longer processing time.


    > ### Note:  
    > You can filter your search by *First Name*, *Last Name*, *Scim ID*, *Email*, or *Login Name*.

6.  Save your changes.
