# Configure the Remember Me Option

Tenant administrators can configure the *Remember me* option as visible or hidden, and checked or unchecked.



## Context

With the remember me option, a cookie is sent to the browser so the users can log on to an application without the need to provide their credentials every time they access it. The default configuration for the remember me option is: visible and unchecked. The default validity for remember me is 3 months. If the default configuration is preferred, users see the remember me option on the logon screen:

> ### Note:  
> Remember me tokens generated for an application are valid for all applications in the tenant. If the option is enabled, the cookie validity of the first application that is accessed by the user is taken into consideration and all other applications have the same cookie validity despite their configuration in the administration console.

> ### Restriction:  
> The remember me option is supported only when Identity Authentication is set as the default local identity provider for the application. When the authentication is done via a corporate identity provider no cookie is sent to the user's browser.
