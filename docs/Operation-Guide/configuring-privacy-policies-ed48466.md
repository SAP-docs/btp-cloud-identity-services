# Configuring Privacy Policies

You can configure a custom privacy policy document by creating a new document, adding and editing its language versions, and defining the document for an application.

Every time you want to update the privacy policy document you add a new language versions for the document.

Each privacy policy document can have one draft and one active version. You can view all language version in the administration console. Optionally you can edit the draft version of a document before making it an active version.

Once a privacy policy document is created it can't be renamed.

For each language version, you have to upload a text file. You can define a privacy policy document in the following languages:

Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese \(PRC\), Chinese \(Taiwan\), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English \(United Kingdom\), English \(United States\), Estonian, Finnish, French \(Standard\), French \(Canada\), German \(Standard\), Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese \(Portugal\), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish \(Spain\), Spanish \(Mexico\), Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Welsh.

The language is defined in the following order of importance:

-   By the `locale` parameter in the URL used for accessing the application.

    > ### Note:  
    > If the SP is configured to support a specific language, only this language is used by the application.

-   By the language of the application's browser.

    > ### Note:  
    > The application takes the browser language only if the SP's language is not selected, and the `locale` parameter isnâ€™t set in the URL. The default browser setting is *English*.


> ### Note:  
> If there is only one language for the document, it is recommended to be *English \(United States\)*.
> 
> If the languages are more than one, one of them must be *English \(United States\)*.
