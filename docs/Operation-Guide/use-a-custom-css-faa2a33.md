# Use a Custom CSS

Upload a CSS file and assign that file to an application for advanced customization of the end-user screens and the profile page for the Quartz or Horizon Theme.



## Context

To use a custom CSS for the application end-user screens and profile page, you must upload your custom CSS file in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services and then assign that file to the application.

> ### Caution:  
> When working with custom CSS documents or importing CSS documents from external sources, always consider the following safety guidelines:
> 
> -   *Validate Sources* - Before importing a CSS file from an external source, be sure that you trust the provider.
> -   *Review Content* - Inspect the content of the external CSS file to ensure it doesn't contain any security vulnerabilities.
> -   *Monitor Regularly* - Periodically review and update the imported CSS documents to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities.
