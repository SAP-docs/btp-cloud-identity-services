# Using Authorization Code Flow

To authenticate using the authorization code flow, follow the procedures below. Tasks 1 and 2 are configurations on Identity Authentication side. Tasks 3 and 4 are configurations, done on the client \(relying party\) side.

> ### Recommendation:  
> Follow the best practices of [RFC 9700](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html#name-authorization-code-grant) and use PKCE for confidential clients. You must use PKCE for public clients.
