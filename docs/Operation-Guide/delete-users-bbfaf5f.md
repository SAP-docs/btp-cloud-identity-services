    The system displays the first 20 users in the tenant sorted by their user ID number.

3.  Select the checkbox next to the user or users that you want to delete.

    > ### Tip:  
    > If you don't see the user or users that you want to delete, you can expand the list or use the search field. For more information, see [Search Users](search-users-06078a6.md).

4.  Press *Delete*.

5.  Confirm the operation.

    > ### Caution:  
    > If the user you delete is also an administrator, he or she will be removed from the administrator list too. For more information about how to remove and administrator, without deleting it from the user data base, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).
