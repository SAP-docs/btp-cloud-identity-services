This topic shows you how to choose a type for the corporate identity provider.



## Prerequisites

## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Identity Providers*, choose the *Corporate Identity Providers* tile.

3.  Select the corporate identity provider that you want to configure.

4.  Choose *Identity Provider Type*.

5.  Select the radio button for the type of the identity provider.

    You can choose one of the following options:

    -   SAML 2.0 Compliant

    -   SAP Single Sign-On \(SAML 2.0\)

    -   Microsoft ADFS / Entra ID \(SAML 2.0\)

        > ### Caution:  
        > For this type the digest algorithm of the corporate identity provider must be *SHA-256*. For more information, see 2.
