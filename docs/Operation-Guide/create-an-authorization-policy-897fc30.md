# Create an Authorization Policy

Identity Authentication administrators can use existing authorization policies to create an authorization policy, configure rules, and assign the authorization policies to users.

## Context

You have the following options:

-   Create an authorization policy based on the rules of a custom authorization policy, add restrictions, or change the attribute.

-   Create an authorization policy by combining authorization policies \(either base or custom authorization policies\).

## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications & Resources*, choose *Applications*.

3.  Choose a bundled application that supports authorization management. For information, see the documentation of the application.

    The details page of your bundled application has an *Authorization Policies* tab.

4.  Choose the *Authorization Policies* tab.

5.  Choose :heavy_plus_sign: \(Create new policy\).

6.  Choose one of the following options:

    -   *Restrict* Add restrictions and attributes or only change attributes. See [Edit an Authorization Policy](edit-an-authorization-policy-c76aca6.md).

    -   *Combine* Create one authorization policy with an OR combination of the rules of two authorization policies. See [Combine Authorization Policies](combine-authorization-policies-1a69414.md).


    You can now continue by giving the authorization policy a name, choosing the base policies, assigning it to a user or changing its rule.
