4.  Choose the *Authorization Policies* tab.

5.  Choose *Create*.

6.  Choose one of the following options:

    -   *Create Restriction* Create an authorization policy based on base policies, edit rules, add restrictions, statements, and attributes or only change attributes. See [Edit an Authorization Policy](edit-an-authorization-policy-c76aca6.md).
