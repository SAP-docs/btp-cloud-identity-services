# Manage Transformations

You can manage transformations with graphical and JSON text editor. Regardless of which one you choose, the following initial steps are the same.

> ### Note:  
> The graphical editor is available only for Identity Provisioning tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure. It is the default editor.

> ### Note:  
> This documentation refers to the Identity Provisioning service on Neo environment. If you are looking for information about Identity Provisioning service in the SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure, please refer to the [SAP Cloud Identity Services](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/what-is-identity-authentication?version=Cloud) documentation.

1.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI and choose a tile â€“ *Source Systems*, *Target Systems*, or *Proxy Systems*.

    Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Source Systems*, *Target Systems* or *Proxy Systems*.

2.  Select a system from the left panel and go to the *Transformations* tab.

    The graphical editor is displayed by default. You can switch to the JSON editor by choosing the code-bracket icon.

3.  Choose *Edit*. You need to work in edit mode to add, modify and delete entities and their configurations.

    -   Working with the JSON editor allows you to type changes and perform operations like select, cut, copy and paste the transformation code.

    -   Working with the graphical editor allows you to graphically model your changes.


4.  Save your changes.
