# Manage Certificates

Identity Provisioning supports certificate-based authentication for secure communication with the provisioning systems \(connectors\) provided by the service.

## Context

Certificates can be used in outbound and inbound connections to Identity Provisioning.

In **outbound connections**, Identity Provisioning acts as an SSL client. The service generates an X.509 client certificate for mutual Transport Layer Security \(mTLS\) authentication against a given provisioning system acting as a server. The Identity Provisioning client certificate must be uploaded to the given provisioning system for configuring the certificate-based authentication there. For example, in SAP BTP ABAP Environment, the Identity Provisioning certificate must be uploaded to the communication user used in the communication arrangement.

> ### Note:  
> Outbound certificates generated by Identity Provisioning can also be used for OAuth authentication with provisioning systems. In OAuth certificate authentication, Identity Provisioning acts as a client application that sends requests to the URL of the access token provider service \(the authorization server\). The server issues access tokens following a successful authentication with certificate \(instead of using client ID and client secret\).
> 
> Currently, OAuth certificate authentication is supported for SAP Business Network and Procurement Data Warehouse.

In **inbound connections**, Identity Provisioning acts as a server whereas the given provisioning system acts as a client and must present a client certificate for establishing the communication to the service. Customers of bundle and standalone tenants running on SAP BTP, Neo environment import client certificates in the Identity Provisioning admin console. Customers of bundle and standalone tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure upload the client certificates in the Identity Authentication admin console on the technical user of type *System*.

Inbound certificates are supported for source and proxy systems in the following scenarios: configuring proxy systems and real-time provisioning.

> ### Note:  
> Client certificate authentication is not supported for systems where the *ProxyType* and *ldap.proxyType* properties, required for the HTTP and LDAP connection respectively, are set to `OnPremise`.

> ### Note:  
> If you are using Identity Provisioning proxy and real-time provisioning scenarios, ensure that you trust the new root CA: DigiCert Global Root G2 as the old one DigiCert Global Root CA will be deprecated.
