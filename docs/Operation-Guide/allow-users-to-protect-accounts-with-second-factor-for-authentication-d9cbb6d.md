## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

If applications don't require second factor for authentication, or the applications have configured risk-based authentication rules requiring second factor, but the users don't fall into these rules that require second factor for authentication, the users can enhance their security by switching on the *Multi-Factor Authentication* option on the profile page.

This option is visible on the profile page, only if the administrator has allowed it via the administration console.

When the *Multi-Factor Authentication* option in the administration console is switched on, the users can choose to always provide second factor when authenticating.

If users chose the *Trust this browser* checkbox, the second factor is required only with the first logon. The validity of *Trust this browser* depends on the configuration in the administration console. It can be set between 1 and 14 days. If the additional option for trust this browser is set at *Disabled* the validity of *Trust this browser* is 3 months. But if the administrator sets a validity from 1 to 14 days, the 3-month validity is overridden with the validity set by the tenant administrator.

To enable or disable the*Multi-Factor Authentication* option in the administration console, follow the procedure below:



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Tenant Settings* tile.

    At the top of the page, you can view the administrative and license relevant information of the tenant.

3.  Choose the *Multi-Factor Authentication* list item.

4.  Enable or disable the *Multi-Factor Authentication* option.

    If the operation is successful, the system displays the message ***Multi-Factor authentication updated***.
