# Define a Terms of Use Document for an Application



## Context

The terms of use document is displayed on the registration form, which form appears when the user chooses the *Register Now* link on the logon page. It is also shown to the user when the registration information has been upgraded. By default, the application is set not to use a terms of use document on the registration and upgrade forms. To change this configuration, you have to update the *None* setting in the administration console.

If you have the authorization, you can create a custom terms of use document. This document is used once you have set it for the respective application.



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Authentication and Access* tab.
