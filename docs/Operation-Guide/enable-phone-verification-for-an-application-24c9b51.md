## Context

This option requires the user to provide his or her phone number in the registration or upgrade forms. After that the user receives a verification code which must be provided so that the registration or upgrade is completed. If the code fails to arrive, the user has up to five attempts to request a new code via SMS.

After that the user can either contact the system adminstrator or request a code via a phone call. Again the user has up to five attempts to request a new code via phone call. The user can trigger one phone call per session.

When this feature is enabled, the `Phone` attribute becomes required and is not configurable for user registration or upgrade. For more information, see [Configure Registration and Upgrade Forms](configure-registration-and-upgrade-forms-93a9e18.md).



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Branding and Layout* tab.

5.  Under *APPLICATION FORMS CUSTOMIZATION*, enable *Phone Verification via SMS*.

    If the operation is successful, you receive the following message: ***Application <Application Name\> updated***. The slider is switched to *ON*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you do not want to use phone verification via SMS for an application, you can drag the slider next to it to *OFF*.

6.  **Optional:** Configure rules to skip phone verification for user types and save your changes. To configure the authentication rules, choose one of the following:
