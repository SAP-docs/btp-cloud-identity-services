# Use IdP-Initiated Single Logout \(SLO\)

Use this procedure to start the single logout \(SLO\) process at Identity Authentication as an identity provider.



## Context

Single Logout \(SLO\) enables users to cleanly close all their sessions in an SSO landscape, even across domains. In this identity provider \(IdP\) initiated SLO scenario, the user initiates a logout request at Identity Authentication being an identity provider.

SLO can also be initiated at the corporate identity provider \(IdP\). Identity Authentication accepts SLO requests from corporate identity providers via both SAML and OpenID Connect.



## Procedure

1.  Direct the user browser to your SLO endpoint.

    Identity Authentication single logout endpoint follows the template `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/saml2/idp/slo` or `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.cloud.sap/saml2/idp/slo`

2.  **Optional:** Add the `RelayState` URL parameter.

    > ### Remember:  
    > `RelayState` is the only supported parameter. `RelayState` must be a trusted domain and valid URL. For example, `https://myapplication.ondemand.com/saml2/idp/slo?RelayState=https://example.com`




<a name="loioda2e4f9866dc45f0b4723ca41f051bea__result_nnr_xm1_dlb"/>

## Results

After successful logout, the identity provider either redirects the user to the URL provided in the RelayState, or if RelayState isnâ€™t provided, the user is redirected to the profile page.
