# Start and Stop Provisioning Jobs

You can start and stop a provisioning job from the Identity Provisioning user interface \(UI\)or from an API client by using the Identity Provisioning tenant admin API.

## Prerequisites

-   Your source and target systems are configured and enabled.

-   \(Optional\) You have run a *Simulate* and/or a *Validate* job before you run the actual provisioning job to verify that Identity Provisioning configurations produce the desired result in the target systems.

*Read Job* - Reads all entities from the source system and provisions only new or updated entities to the target system. If the job is run in **delta read** mode, it reads and provisions only new or updated entities in the source system.

*Resync Job* - Reads all entities from the source system and provisions all entities to the target system.

See [Resync Provisioning Job](resync-provisioning-job-668c991.md)

*Simulate Job* - Estimates the number of entities that will be created, updated, deleted or skipped in the target system. Provides the expected results of a resync job without modifying the target system.

*Validate Job* - Verifies how entities \(users and groups\) would be mapped from source to target systems without modifying them.
