# Configure Identity Federation

Tenant administrators can configure whether the attributes are taken from the assertion of the corporate identity provider or from the user store of Identity Authentication, and can restrict access based on the user profile.



## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Corporate Identity Providers* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You have configured Identity Authentication to use a corporate identity provider as an external authenticating authority. For more information, see [Configure Trust with SAML 2.0 Corporate Identity Provider](configure-trust-with-saml-2-0-corporate-identity-provider-33832e5.md) or [Configure Identity Federation](configure-identity-federation-c029bbb.md).

-   You have selected the configured identity provider as the authenticating identity provider for your application. For more information, see [Choose Default Identity Provider for an Application](choose-default-identity-provider-for-an-application-e9d8274.md).

-   You have imported the users, authenticated by the corporate identity provider, in Identity Authentication. For more information about how to import users, see [Import or Update Users for a Specific Application](import-or-update-users-for-a-specific-application-33838e0.md).




## Context

The *Identity Federation* option allows you to choose whether the user attributes are taken from the corporate IdP assertion or from Identity Authentication user store. You can also restrict access based on the user profile, and additionally apply the custom application configurations for the authentication and access policies.



### User Store

By default, *Use Identity Authentication user store* is disabled.

In scenarios when the application is using for authentication a corporate identity provider, and the *Use Identity Authentication user store* option is disabled, the user attributes, the name ID attribute, and the default attributes configurations in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services are not relevant. In such scenarios, Identity Authentication sends to the application the same attributes it has received from the corporate identity provider. For more information about the corporate identity provider scenario, see [Corporate Identity Providers](corporate-identity-providers-19f3eca.md).

When *Use Identity Authentication user store* option is enabled, the application checks if the users authenticated by the corporate identity provider exist in the Identity Authentication user store. The existence check is done with the name identifier sent by the corporate identity provider for the identifying attributes `uid`, `loginName`, `emails` and `phoneNumber`.

For users that exist in Identity Authentication, data from Identity Authentication user store is taken and the subject name identifier, assertion and default attributes according to the application configuration are sent. For users with no profile in Identity Authentication, the application receives the nameID attribute from the corporate IdP assertion, and the attributes according to the application configuration.



### User Access

When *Allow Identity Authentication users only* is enabled, only the users that exist in Identity Authentication can access the application.

By default, *Allow Identity Authentication users only* is disabled, and all users successfully authenticated to the corporate IdP are allowed.



### Restrict Logon to Members of Certain Groups from the Corporate Identity Provider

As a next step, you can assign a group or groups to the corporate identity provider. Only users from the Identity Authentication that are members of the assigned group can access the application.

> ### Remember:  
> You can assign groups, only when *Allow Identity Authentication users only* option is enabled. If disabled, the assigned groups option is not taken into consideration.



### Application Configuration

By default, *Apply Application Configurations* is disabled.

When enabled, the custom application configurations for authentication and access policies are applied.

When this option is enabled, the user is authenticated by the corporate IdP, then Identity Authentication checks for the configurations for authentication and access policies on application level, and applies them. They include Risk-Based-Authentication, Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Upgrade and Registration Forms.

> ### Remember:  
> The concurrent user access configuration is always applied for the application regardless of the *Apply Application Configurations* state.
