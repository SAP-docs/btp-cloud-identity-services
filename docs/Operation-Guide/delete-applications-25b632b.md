# Delete Applications

As a tenant administrator, you can delete one or more charged or bundled applications in a tenant of Identity Authentication.



## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Applications* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You have at least one bundled or charged application that you want to delete.




## Context

A *Delete Applications* operation removes the application and all of its configurations from the tenant of Identity Authentication.

> ### Note:  
> You can only delete charged or non-SAP managed bundled applications. The system applications and the bundled applications that are managed and configured by SAP cannot be deleted. For more information, see [Application Types](../application-types-8f61880.md) and [Configure an Application's Type](configure-an-application-s-type-6fee9c3.md).

Follow the procedure below for each application that you want to delete:

4.  Choose the *Delete* button in the right-hand panel to delete the selected application.
