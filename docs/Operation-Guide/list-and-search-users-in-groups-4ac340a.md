# List and Search Users in Groups

As a tenant administrator, you can list and view information about the users in a group in a tenant in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.



## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Groups* and *Manage Users* roles. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You have created at least one user group in the tenant. For more details about how to create groups, see Related Information.

-   You have assigned at least one user to the selected user group. For more details about how to assign groups to a user, see Related Information.



## Context



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Choose the *Groups* tile.

    This operation opens a list of the groups in the tenant.

3.  Type a `Group ID`, `Display Name`, or `Name` of a group in the search field in order to filter the list items.

    > ### Tip:  
    > Choose *Show Filter Bars* for advanced search. You must be assigned to a policy that allows reading applications to view the information for *Application Name*.

4.  Choose a group from the list.

    This will open the groups details \(*Group ID*, *Name*, *Display Name*, *Description*, *Type*, and *Application Name*\) on the right. The users that are part of the group are listed below the user group details.

    > ### Restriction:  
    > The group must be application specific and you must be assigned to a policy that allows reading applications to view the *Application Name*. For more information, see [Groups](../groups-d93be69.md).

5.  To search for a specific user, type the *SCIM ID*, *Email*, *Login Name* of the user in the search field and press the *Enter* key.
