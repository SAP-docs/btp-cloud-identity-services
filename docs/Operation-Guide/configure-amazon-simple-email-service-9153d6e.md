# Configure Amazon Simple Email Service

Configure mail server for the emails sent to the end users in the different application processes.



<a name="loio9153d6ef5f3441da8f0633a3f009d86d__prereq_nht_ncc_ffb"/>

## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

By using *Amazon Simple Email Service* you can modify the sender and receiver of the email without the need to have a custom mail server.

To use the Amazon Simple Email Service with custom domain, you must own the domain.

If you don't have an own domain you can use the domain, which is the default one, and just modify the `<username>` part in the *From* and *Reply to* fields. You can add up to two domains in addition to the default one.

Once the tenant administrator configures the mail server, all emails will go through this configuration.

> ### Remember:  
> To return to the default settings, remove the configuration.
> 
> Note that it takes two minutes for each configuration change to be applied.

To configure the mail server, follow the procedure below:



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Tenant Settings* tile.

    At the top of the page, you can view the administrative and license relevant information of the tenant.

3.  Under *External Services*, choose the *Mail Server Configuration* list item.

4.  Choose the *Amazon Simple Email Service* radio-button

5.  **Optional:** To use the Amazon Simple Email Service with custom domain, Ð°dd a valid domain name in the dialog box that appears.

    1.  Copy the TXT and CNAME records that are created in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services and enter them in the DNS server.

    2.  Choose *Verify* to check the status of the domain in the administration console.

        Domain verification may take up to 72 hours to complete \(usually it takes around 5 minutes\).

        Status of the domain will change from *Pending* to *Verified* if Amazon has verified the domain, otherwise it will change to *Failed* after 72 hours.

        If you want to start the verification process again, you need to delete the domain and add it again.


6.  Configure the <username\> parts in the *From* and *Reply to* fields under *Communication Emails*.

    > ### Note:  
    > The <username\> part of the email address can have the following:
    > 
    > -   uppercase and lowercase Latin letters
    > 
    > -   digits from 0 to 9
    > 
    > -   special characters !\#$%&'\*+-/=?^\_\`\{|\}~
    > 
    > 
    > The <domain\> part of the email address can have the following:
    > 
    > -   uppercase and lowercase Latin letters
    > 
    > -   digits from 0 to 9
    > 
    > -   hyphen
    > 
    > 
    > You can't specify a hyphen at the beginning or end.

    > ### Caution:  
    > If you have more than one verified domain, make sure that you have selected the correct ones from the drop down in the domain part under *Communication Emails*.

7.  Save your entries.

    If the operation is successful, you receive the message ***Configuration saved***.

    > ### Tip:  
    > To return to the default settings, remove the configuration.




## Example

**Testing Mail Server Configuration**

Access the profile page at `https://<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com/` from a new browser where you do not have an active session with Identity Authentication. Choose the *Forgot password?* link from the logon page to start the reset password process.

> ### Remember:  
> Only three emails are allowed to be sent via Identity Authentication for 24 hour. If you have already reached the limit, the system will not send an email. To check the number of emails sent to the user, access *administration console for SAP Clou Identity Services* \> *Users & Authorizations* \> *User Management* \> *your user* \> *Authentication* \> *Password Details*. Next to *Password Reset* you can see the number of emails sent to the user. If necessary, choose *Reset Counter* to be able to send more emails.

If the reset password email is sent successfully, and the configuration is correct, the email that you receive should have as a sender the email specified in the configuration.

If the configuration is not correct, no email is sent.
