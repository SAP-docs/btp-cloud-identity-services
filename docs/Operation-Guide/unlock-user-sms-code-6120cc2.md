# Unlock User SMS Code

You can unlock a user SMS code when the user must log on to the application before the automatic unlock time of 60 minutes has passed.



## Context

The user locks his or her SMS code after requesting five codes when trying to log on to an application that requires SMS two-factor authentication. The code is unlocked automatically after 60 minutes.

> ### Caution:  
> If the user phone is not verified, the code will not be unlocked after 60 minutes. In this case you should unlock the code via the procedure below.

> ### Note:  
> When the user locks his or her SMS code, he or she will not be able to log on only to applications that require SMS codes. The applications that do not require SMS two-factor authentication will be accessible only with the user password.

To unlock the user SMS code manually, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Find the user whose SMS code you want to unlock.

    For more information about how to find a user in Identity Authentication, see [Search Users](search-users-06078a6.md).

2.  Select the user that you want to unlock.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can only unlock locked user SMS codes.

3.  Choose the *Authentication* tab.

4.  Choose the *Authentication* tab.

5.  Choose *Multi-Factor Authentication*.

6.  Press *Unlock* under *SMS Status*.

    The system displays the message ***Account <name of user\> unlocked***.
