# Using Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow

To get access using the resource owner password credentials flow, follow the procedures below.

Tasks 1 and 2 are configurations on Identity Authentication. Task 3 is a configuration on the client \(relying party\).

> ### Restriction:  
> Only corporate identity providers configured with OpenID Connect \(OIDC\) support this flow.
> 
> If you've configured a corporate identity provider for your application, multifactor authentication isn't supported with this flow. For human users we recommend that you use a web-based flow like the authorization code flow.
