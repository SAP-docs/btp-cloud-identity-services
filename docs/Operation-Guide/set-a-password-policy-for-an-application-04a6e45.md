# Set a Password Policy for an Application

As a tenant administrator, you can set a password policy that matches your application logon requirements.



## Context

You can choose from standard, enterprise, and custom password policies. The standard and enterprise password policies are predefined, and you cannot configure them. You can configure only the custom password policy.

The strength of the policies grows from standard to custom.

When a user is authenticated for specific application, or there is already an active session with that application, Identity Authentication checks the application's requirement for password policy and the current user's password policy and always applies the stronger policy. Thus even if the application doesn't require an enterprise password policy if the user has already authenticated in application which requires enterprise password policy then the enterprise password policy rules will be applied even if the user accesses an application that doesn't require it.

> ### Tip:  
> To see the configuration of the password policies in the tenant, go to *Password Polices* tile and choose the ![](images/DisplayPassPolicy_38584e8.png) icon next to the policy you want to view.

To set a password policy for an application, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Authentication and Access* tab.

5.  Under *POLICIES*, choose *Password Policy*.

6.  Select the radio button for the password policy.

7.  Save your selection.

    Once the application has been updated, the system displays the message ***Application <name of application\> updated***.

    > ### Note:  
    > When the user tries to log on to the application whose password policy has been updated, he or she is prompted to change the password if the current one does not meet the requirements in the updated password policy.
