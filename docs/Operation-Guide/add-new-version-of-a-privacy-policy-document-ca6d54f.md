## Context

To update an existing privacy policy document you must add a new version for each language of this document by uploading a UTF-8 encoded plain text file containing the updated privacy policy statement. Once the new version is uploaded it is in a status draft. You must activate it to replace the current active version. To make a draft version active, you must have draft versions for all the languages that the current active version has.
