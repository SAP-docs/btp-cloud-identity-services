# Tenant SAML 2.0 Configurations

You as a tenant administrator can view and download the tenant SAML 2.0 metadata. You can also change the name format and update your certificate used by the identity provider to digitally sign the messages for the applications.



<a name="loioe81a19b0067f4646982d7200a8dab3ca__prereq_wcy_1vf_ppb"/>

## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

> ### Note:  
> The signing certificate is one and the same for SAML 2.0 and OpenId Connect. Note that a change in one of the configurations will also affect the other one.

> ### Remember:  
> The signature and digest methods in the XML of the metadata file depend on the signing certificate, which is configured for the identity provider. If the certificate is issued with the *SHA256withRSA* algorithm, then the signature method is `rsa-sha256`, and the digest method is `sha256`. In all other cases, for example, if the certificate is issued with the *SHA256withECDSA* algorithm, the signature method is `rsa-sha1`, and the digest method is `sha1`.
> 
> By default, the signing certificates of the new tenants are issued with the *SHA256withRSA*.
> 
> > ### Remember:  
> > It takes 2 minutes for the configuration changes to take place.

To view and download the tenant SAML 2.0 metadata, or to change the name format, or the default certificate, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Tenant Settings* tile.

    At the top of the page, you can view the administrative and license relevant information of the tenant.

3.  Under *Single Sign-On*, choose the *SAML 2.0 Configuration* list item.

    The *SAML 2.0 Configuration* page that opens displays the name of the identity provider, its endpoints, and its signing certificate.

4.  **Optional:** To download the identity provider's metadata, press the *Download Metadata File* button and choose one of the options.

    -   *Default-certificate*
    -   *Non-default certificate*
    -   *All certificates*

5.  **Optional:** To change the name of the identity provider, choose the *Name* field, select the name from the dropdown list, and save your changes.

    The drop-down list offers the following options:


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Issuer
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Notes
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Default Issuer format
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    https://<tenant ID\>.accounts.ondemand.com
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Legacy Issuer format
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    <tenant ID\>.accounts.ondemand.com
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Common domain
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    https://<tenant ID\>.accounts.cloud.sap
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Custom Domain \(if configured\)
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    <custom domain host\>
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Tenants in China region
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    https:// <tenant ID\>.accounts.sapcloud.cn
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    > ### Note:  
    > Tenant ID is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation email with a URL in it. This URL contains the tenant ID.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Change the name of the identity provider on the service provider side, or the name of the identity provider on the corporate identity provider side, every time you change the name format of the identity provider in the administration console. If you have set trusts with more than one service provider, or corporate identity provider, change the name in every provider. For more information about how to edit the name, see the documentation of the respective service or corporate identity providers.

    If the change of the name is successful, the system displays the message ***Tenant <name of tenant\> updated***.

6.  **Optional:** Update your signing certificate. You can choose from the following options:

    -   To regenerate the existing certificate with new validity, reusing the same private key, choose *Add* \> *Regenerate* \> *Next Step* \> *choose validity from the drop down* \> *Next Step* \> *Finish* \> *Save*.

    -   To create a new certificate with a new private key and the same Subject DN, choose *Add* \> *Create new* \> *Next Step* \> *choose key size and validity from the drop downs* \> *Next Step* \> *Finish* \> *Save*.
    -   To create a new certificate, using your own trusted CA, choose *Add* \> *Download CSR* \> *Next Step* \> *add Subject DN and choose key size and validity from the drop downs* \> *Next Step* \> *Download CSR*.

        When you get your certificate, copy and paste it as text in the View Certificate Details dialog.

## Next Steps

To change the default certificate for the tenant, choose the new one from the list, and save your configuration.

> ### Caution:  
> When you change the default certificate for the tenant, you must also update the trust with the service provider.
