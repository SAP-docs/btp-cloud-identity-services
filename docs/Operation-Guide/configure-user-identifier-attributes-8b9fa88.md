# Configure User Identifier Attributes

Tenant administrators can configure user identifier attributes as required and unique for the tenant.



<a name="loio8b9fa88649ae4d86a4ab4baf8fb0e007__prereq_m1z_5zf_ppb"/>

## Prerequisites

You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).



## Context

Identity Authentication ensures the uniqueness only of the newly set values of the attributes. The system doesn’t guarantee the uniqueness of the existing attributes.

The default configuration for the user identifiers are:

> ### Caution:  
> The `User ID` and `Login Name` identifiers of a user can't have values that are equal to the `User ID`, `Email`, `Login Name`, `Display Name`, and `Phone` identifiers of another user.
> 
> When `Email` or `Phone` identifiers of a user are set as unique they can't have values that are equal to the `User ID`, `Email`, `Login Name`, `Display Name`, and `Phone` identifiers of another user.

> ### Remember:  
> If the `DisplayName` is edited via the profile page, consider the following:
> 
> -   When the `Display Name` identifier of a user is set as unique it can't have values that are equal to the `User ID`, `Global User ID`, `Email`, `Display Name`, `Login Name`, and `Employee Number` identifiers of another user.
> 
> -   When the `Display Name` identifier of a user is set as non-unique it can't have values equal to the `User ID`, `Global User ID`, `Email`, `Login Name`, and `Employee Number` identifiers of another user.

> ### Note:  
> The `Display Name` user identifier for the tenants created before the system upgrade on May 13, 2020 is configured as required and unique.
> 
> The `Phone` user attribute is configured as non-unique by default. If you configure it as unique, all users that are created or updated after this configuration won't be able to have phone numbers taken by someone else.

> ### Remember:  
> If `Email` is marked as not-required on tenant level, it becomes configurable on application level, and must also be changed there, too. For more information, see [Configure Registration and Upgrade Forms](configure-registration-and-upgrade-forms-93a9e18.md).

The texts on the end screen are predefined. If you change the required/unique preference in the tenant, this won’t automatically change the texts in the end-user page. To change the text, you must update the predefined texts and messages for end-user screens available per tenant in the Identity Authentication. For more information, see [Change Tenant Texts REST API](../Development/change-tenant-texts-rest-api-66ad80a.md#loio66ad80a6bbaf4fc3911232f7cc9a7de6).

Although the choice for the `required` attribute is applied for all applications in the tenant, you can still make the *Email* required on the registration and upgrade form for specific applications via a custom configuration. For more information, see [Configure Registration and Upgrade Forms](configure-registration-and-upgrade-forms-93a9e18.md)

> ### Remember:  
> It takes 2 minutes for the configuration changes to take place.

If you want to change the configuration for the user identifier for your tenant, follow the procedure below:



## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Tenant Settings* tile.

    At the top of the page, you can view the administrative and license relevant information of the tenant.

3.  Under *Authentication*, choose the *Logon Alias* list item.

4.  Select the options for the user identifier according to your needs.

    -   Required
    -   Unique

    If the operation is successful, the system displays the message ***Logon alias updated***. It takes two minutes for the change to be applied.
