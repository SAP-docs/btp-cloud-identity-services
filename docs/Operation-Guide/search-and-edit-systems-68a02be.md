<a name="loio68a02bea560142c2a033f555eafd5509__context_mst_qtj_b1c"/>

## Context

Paging is enabled by default. The number of systems loaded per page is 20. They are sorted by type \(*Customer Managed*, *SAP Initiated* and *SAP Managed*\) and state \(*Enabled* and *Disabled*\) in the following order:

1.  Customer Managed, enabled systems are displayed alphabetically

2.  Customer Managed, disabled systems are displayed alphabetically

3.  SAP Initiated, enabled systems are displayed alphabetically

4.  SAP Initiated, disabled systems are displayed alphabetically

5.  SAP Managed, enabled systems are displayed alphabetically

6.  SAP Managed, disabled systems are displayed alphabetically


> ### Note:  
> If you can't find the system you are searching for, choose *More* to expand the list of systems as many times as needed until it is displayed.



## Procedure

1.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI and choose a tile â€“ *Source Systems*, *Target Systems*, or *Proxy Systems*.

2.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Source Systems*, *Target Systems* or *Proxy Systems*.

3.  From the list on the left, either directly select a system, or search for it and select it.

4.  Select a tab and edit the configurations.

    -   *Details*
    -   *Transformations*
    -   *Properties*
    -   *Outbound Certificates*

5.  Choose the *Edit* button and make your changes.
