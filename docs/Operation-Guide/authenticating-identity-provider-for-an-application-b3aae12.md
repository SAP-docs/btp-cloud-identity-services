# Authenticating Identity Provider for an Application

You can choose an authenticating identity provider for the application.



## Context

You have the following options for an authenticating identity provider in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services for both bundled and charged applications, and for system applications \(`Administration Console`, and `User Profile`\):

-   Local Identity Provider

    Identity Authentication is set as the default local identity provider for bundled, charged, and system applications.

    The local identity provider gives you access to all application settings in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

    > ### Note:  
    > When Identity Authentication is set as the default authenticating provider, and the service provider \(SP\) is configured to send a `login_hint` parameter, the user identifier is prefilled on the login screen.
    > 
    > The `login_hint` parameter is sent according to the configuration done on tenant level. For more information, see [Configure Login Hint Parameter](configure-login-hint-parameter-c6dd6a5.md).
    > 
    > The `login_hint` parameter helps the user when he or she is known to the service provider \(SP\). Thus it prevents the user from re-typing the user identifier on the logon or conditional screen.

-   Corporate Identity Provider

    -   Identity Authentication can act as a proxy to delegate authentication to the external corporate identity provider for both bundled and charged applications, and for system applications.

        > ### Note:  
        > When Identity Authentication is set as proxy, and the service provider \(SP\) is configured to send a `login_hint` parameter, the `login_hint` coming from the SP will be sent to the corporate IdP in the authentication request.
        > 
        > The `login_hint` parameter helps the user when he or she is known to the service provider \(SP\). Thus it prevents the user from re-typing the user identifier on the logon or conditional screen.

        > ### Remember:  
        > If you want to use a corporate identity provider for a system application, the `name ID` attribute sent in the assertion by that corporate identity provider must match the *Email*, *Login Name* or *User ID* attribute of the user in the user store of Identity Authentication.
        > 
        > You should also configure the following options for that corporate provider in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services:
        > 
        > 1.  Enable *Use Identity Authentication user store*.
        > 2.  \(Optional\) Enable *Apply Application Configurations*. This is needed if you want to apply the custom application configurations for authentication and access policies.
        > 
        > For more information about how to enable these options, see [Configure Identity Federation](configure-identity-federation-c029bbb.md)

    -   Identity Authentication can act also as a proxy to delegate authentication to multiple external corporate identity providers for again both bundled and charged applications, and for system applications. The scenario includes more than one corporate IdP so the tenant administrator must define URLs that lead users to the application and predefine the IdP that should be used. Thus the users don't need to know about the different IdPs and don't need to choose any. For example one corporate IdP is for employees login, and another is for customers. By default, the application redirects to the IdP for clients, while the employees have a crafted link in their corporate portal page, starting the application with login via the IdP for employees. Thus, neither the employees, nor the customers need to do anything to reach the right IdP for them.

        In this case, the administrator has the following options:

        -   Configure rules to decide which identity provider to use in which case. For more information, see [Configure Conditional Authentication for an Application](configure-conditional-authentication-for-an-application-0143dce.md).

            > ### Note:  
            > This case requires input from the user at sign in.

        -   Provide users with URLs that choose the identity provider. For more information, see [Creating URL To Access Application with Specific Identity Provider](creating-url-to-access-application-with-specific-identity-provider-118f5f4.md).
