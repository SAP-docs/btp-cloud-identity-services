# Configure JWT for OAuth Client Authentication

Configure the JSON Web Token \(JWT\) - the issuer and subject of tokens for JWT client authentication in token requests, or the URI for JSON web key retrieval for client authentication.



<a name="loiodb97a69901484f9da284d582ed0244ff__prereq_lz2_wxt_1tb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have an OpenID Connect application.

-   \(For the *Configure Trust by Issuer*\) You have created and configured a corporate identity provider of type *OpenID Connect Compliant* in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. For more information, see [Configure Trust with OpenID Connect Corporate Identity Provider](configure-trust-with-openid-connect-corporate-identity-provider-8ff83a1.md).




## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Applications and Resources*, choose the *Applications* tile.

3.  Choose the application that you want to edit.

    > ### Note:  
    > Type the name of the application in the search field to filter the list items, or choose the application from the list on the left.
    > 
    > If you donâ€™t have a created application in your list, you can create one. For more information, see [Create a New Application](create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

4.  Choose the *Trust* tab.

5.  Under *Application APIs*, choose *Client Authentication*.

6.  Under *JSON Web Tokens*, configure one of the following options and save your changes:

    -   \(For RFC 7523-based JWT client tokens\) Choose the *Add* button for *Configure Trust by Issuer* and provide the required info in the popup:

        **Configure Trust by URI**
