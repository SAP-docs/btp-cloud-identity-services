# Managing Users

Tenant administrators can manage user accounts via the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services, and via APIs.

The user management enables you to create, modify, and delete users and their attributes, and manage the user accounts in the user store of Identity Authentication.

> ### Note:  
> For more information about the users that are authenticated with their corporate credentials from the corporate user store, see [Corporate User Store \(Neo Environment\)](corporate-user-store-neo-environment-461d71c.md#loio461d71c148594608b9c8b6d016e0a0c5).

> ### Remember:  
> To perform user management operations, you must be assigned an administrator role or roles that include the relevant authorizations for the operation. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

With user management, you can perform the following activities:
