    > ### Tip:  
    > For more information about the format of the redirect URIs and post logout redirect URIs, see [OpenID Connect Application Configurations](openid-connect-application-configurations-1ae324e.md).

7.  **Optional:** \(If you added second signing certificate in tenant settings\) Under *Identity Provider Certificate*, choose the certificate to be used.

    > ### Tip:  
    > When the default identity provider certificate is changed with a new one, and the old one is not used anymore, we recommend you to delete the old certificate.

8.  Select the *Client Credentials* grant type.

    > ### Note:  
    > Beware that for each flow the respective grant type must be selected. All other grant types can be deselected if they aren't required by the application.

9.  Save your selection. Once the application has been changed, the system displays the message ***Application <name of application\> updated***.

    > ### Remember:  
    > Configure trust on the client side. See the client documentation for more information about how to configure the trust.
