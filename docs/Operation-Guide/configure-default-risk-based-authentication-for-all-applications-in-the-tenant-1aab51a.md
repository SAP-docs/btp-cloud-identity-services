# Configure Default Risk-Based Authentication for All Applications in the Tenant

You can define rules for authentication according to different risk factors and apply actions like *Allow*, *Deny*, and *Two-Factor Authentication* for all applications in a tenant.



<a name="loio1aab51ae62b94f79b4c6dac7a00857c2__prereq_lx3_qzw_hhb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Tenant Configuration* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   \(For *RADIUS Server Two-Factor Authentication*\) You have requested this feature. For more information how to request and configure RADIUS server in Identity Authentication, see [Configure RADIUS Server Settings \(Beta\)](configure-radius-server-settings-beta-03043ae.md).
-   \(For *SMS Two-Factor Authentication*\) You have an account in Sinch. You have configured Sinch Verification in the administration console for Identity Authentication. For more information, see [Configure Sinch Service in Administration Console](configure-sinch-service-in-administration-console-f4a04ed.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > Sinch Verification account is purchased separately. It is not part of the Identity Authentication contract.

-   \(For *Email OTP Code*\) An Email OTP Code template for the respective languages must exist in the tenant to apply the email OTP code method. If the template does not exist, the user will see the option but when choosing it, the following message will appear: "Sorry, but you are currently not authorized for access".

    For more information how to add email templates, see [Edit or Add an Email Template Set](edit-or-add-an-email-template-set-3c4f397.md).

## Context

> ### Caution:  
> Be careful when you set rules for authentication for the tenant. The rules apply to all applications in the tenant, including the `Administration Console`, if those applications have default risk-based authentication \(no rules created; default action - Allow\). The changes apply immediately when saved, and you may not be able to log in the `Administration Console` again if you don't meet the rules.

On the other hand, if a specific application has risk-based authentication different from the default one \(no rules created; default action - Allow\), and you apply default risk-based authentication for the tenant, the rules for the tenant won't apply to that specific application.

For more information, how to apply risk-based authentication for a specific application, see [Configure Risk-Based Authentication for an Application](configure-risk-based-authentication-for-an-application-bc52fbf.md#loiobc52fbf3d59447bbb6aa22f80d8b6056).

The configured rules manage authentication according to IP range \(specified in CIDR notation\), group membership, authentication method, and type of the authenticating user.

**Authentication Rules**

The created rules are displayed sorted by priority. When a user tries to access the application, the rules evaluate if the user meets the criteria of the rule. The evaluation starts with the rule with the highest priority, until the criteria of a rule are met. If the criteria of a rule are met, the rest of the rules are not evaluated.

**Default Authentication Rule**

If none of the authentication rules meets the criteria, the default authentication rule is applied, For the default authentication rule, you can only configure *Default Action*, which can be *Allow*, *Deny*, or *Two-Factor Authentication*.

> ### Note:  
> If *Two-Factor Authentication* is selected, additionally, you must specify the two-factor method or methods for the user.

The rule is valid for any *IP range*, *Forwarded IP Range*, *Group*, *Authentication Method*, or *User Type*.

> ### Note:  
> We recommend you to enable the back-up channels. Thus, the users can use the option as an alternative when they don't have access to the TOTP device or application. For more information, see [Enable Back-Up Channels to Send Passcode for Deactivation of TOTP Two-Factor Authentication Devices](enable-back-up-channels-to-send-passcode-for-deactivation-of-totp-two-factor-authenticati-782935e.md).

> ### Remember:  
> It takes 2 minutes for the configuration changes to take place.

## Create a New Rule for Risk-Based Authentication on Tenant Level

You can create rules for authentication according to different risk factors.



## Context

> ### Caution:  
> The rules apply on all applications in the tenant, including the `Administration Console` application. If you enable risk-based authentication for the tenant, make sure that you, as a tenant administrator, meet the authentication rules and the default authentication rule. The changes apply immediately when saved, and you may not be able to log in it again if you don't meet the rules.

Each rule contains the following information:

-   **Authentication Action**

    This action is performed if the rule conditions meet the defined criteria.

    You can choose one of the following authenticating actions:

    -   *Allow*

        Identity Authentication allows the authentication of the user in accordance with the rule conditions.

    -   *Deny*

        Identity Authentication denies the authentication of the user in accordance with the rule conditions. You can set this action for a test application for example, or before an application goes live.

        As long as this rule is valid, when users try to log on to the application, they get the following message: *Sorry, but you are currently not authorized for access*.

    -   *Two-Factor Authentication*

        > ### Note:  
        > If *Two-Factor Authentication* is selected, additionally, you must specify the two-factor method or methods for the user:
        > 
        > -   *TOTP Two-Factor Authentication*
        > 
        >     Identity Authentication asks two factors to authenticate the user.
        > 
        >     If you set TOTP two-factor authentication, users are required to provide a time-based one-time password \(TOTP\) called a passcode in addition to their primary credentials. Users also has to install an authenticator application on their mobile devices to generate TOTP passcodes.
        > 
        >     TOTP passcodes are time-based and valid for one logon attempt only.
        > 
        > -   *SMS Two-Factor Authentication*
        > 
        >     Identity Authentication asks two factors to authenticate the user.
        > 
        >     If you set SMS two-factor authentication, users are required to provide an SMS code sent to their mobile devices in addition to their primary credentials.
        > 
        >     > ### Remember:  
        >     > To use *SMS Two-Factor Authentication*, you must have configured Sinch Verification in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. For more information, see [Configure Sinch Service in Administration Console](configure-sinch-service-in-administration-console-f4a04ed.md).
        >     > 
        >     > Users must have their mobile phone numbers verified. The tenant administrator can verify phone numbers manually in the administration console or via the SCIM API. For more information, see [List and Edit User Details](list-and-edit-user-details-045cb01.md) and [Identity Directory API](https://api.sap.com/api/IdDS_SCIM/resource/Users).
        >     > 
        >     > If the user does not have a verified phone number, the number is verified during the first log on when SMS code is required. After the user provides user name and credentials, he or she should provide the phone number in the field and request a code. Then provide the received code in the respective field and choose *Continue*. If the submitted code is correct, the user is allowed access, and the telephone number is verified.
        > 
        > -   *Web Two-Factor Authentication*
        > 
        >     Identity Authentication asks two factors to authenticate the user.
        > 
        >     If you set web two-factor authentication, users are required to authenticate with a device such as the built in biometric scanners or USB, Bluetooth or Near-Field Communication \(NFC\) devices in addition to their primary credentials.
        > 
        > -   *Email OTP Code*
        > 
        >     For security reasons, the Email OTP code is not a recommended two-factor authentication method. You may consider using some of the other methods instead.
        > 
        >     Identity Authentication asks two factors to authenticate the user.
        > 
        >     If you set *Email OTP Code*, users are required to provide the code sent to their email in addition to their primary credentials.
        > 
        >     > ### Remember:  
        >     > An Email OTP Code template for the respective languages must exist in the tenant to apply the email OTP code method. If the template does not exist, the user will see the option but when choosing it, the following message will appear: "Sorry, but you are currently not authorized for access".
        >     > 
        >     > For more information how to add email templates, see [Edit or Add an Email Template Set](edit-or-add-an-email-template-set-3c4f397.md).
        > 
        > -   *RADIUS Server Two Factor Authentication*
        > 
        >     If you set *RADIUS Server Two Factor Authentication*, users are required to provide a RADIUS passcode in addition to their primary credentials. Users must have a RADIUS token \(hard or soft\) configured for them to generate passcodes. For more information about how to configure RADIUS server in Identity Authentication, see [Configure RADIUS Server Settings \(Beta\)](configure-radius-server-settings-beta-03043ae.md).


    The *Action* filed is mandatory.

-   *IP Range*

    Define a range of IP addresses that authentication requests to Identity Authentication can be sent from. The value has to be specified in Classless Inter-Domain Routing \(CIDR\) notation.

    > ### Note:  
    > By default the field is empty, meaning that any IP is allowed.

    > ### Example:  
    > Enter 123.45.67.1/24 to allow users to log on from any IP starting with 123.45.67.

    If no IP range is defined, the rule is valid for all IP ranges.

-   *Forwarded IP Range*

    Define a range of IP addresses for the original IP addresses that authentication requests to Identity Authentication can be sent from. This range is used in conjunction with IP Range in scenarios where authentication requests to Identity Authentication are made by a proxy on-behalf of the user/client. The value has to be specified in Classless Inter-Domain Routing \(CIDR\) notation.

    > ### Remember:  
    > To specify the *Forwarded IP Range*, the *IP Range* must be defined first.

-   *Authentication Method*

    Specify the authenticating method, which the authenticating user has to use. If no method is selected, the rule is valid for any of the methods.

-   *User Type*

    Specify the type, which the authenticating user must have. If no user type is selected, the rule is valid for any of the types.

-   *Group Type*
    -   Cloud Group - default choice
    -   On-Premise Group

-   *Group*

    Specify a cloud or on-premise group, which the authenticating user has to be a member of. If no group is selected, the rule is valid for all users.

    If the rule is valid for an on-premise group, type in the name of the corporate user store group, for which this rule should be valid.

    The cloud groups have to be configured in the administration console for Identity Authentication. For more information, see [Managing Groups](managing-groups-ddd067c.md).

-   *Corporate Attribute*

    Specify an attribute from the corporate identity provider \(IdP\) assertion, based on which the rule action will be applied.

    The rule must include the attribute name and value. It is valid only when the specified name and value are found in the assertion from the corporate IdP.

    > ### Note:  
    > For this rule, the *Apply Application Configurations* option of *Identity Federation* must be enabled. For more information, see [Configure Identity Federation](configure-identity-federation-c029bbb.md).

-   *Email Domain*

    Specify a domain for the email of the authenticating user.


The fields *IP Range*, *Forwarded IP Range*, *Group*, *Authentication Method*, and *User Type* are not mandatory, but at least one of them has to be specified.
