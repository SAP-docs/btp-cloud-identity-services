# Define a Privacy Policy Document for an Application



## Context

The privacy policy is displayed on the registration form, which form appears when the user chooses the *Register Now* link on the logon page. It is also shown to the user when the registration information has been upgraded. Initially, the application is set to use a default privacy policy on the registration and upgrade forms. To change this configuration, you have to select a custom privacy policy.

If you have the authorization, you can create a custom privacy policy document. This document is used once you have set it for the respective application.
