# Unlock User TOTP Passcode

You can unlock a user passcode when the user must log on to the application before the automatic unlock time of 60 minutes has passed.



## Context

The user locks his or her passcode after submitting five incorrect passcodes when trying to log on to an application that requires time-based one-time \(TOTO\) two-factor authentication. The passcode is unlocked automatically after 60 minutes.

> ### Note:  
> When the user locks his or her TOTP passcode, he or she will not be able to log on only to applications that require TOTP passcodes. The applications that do not require two-factor authentication will be accessible only with the user password.

To unlock the user TOTP passcode manually, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Find the user whose TOTP passcode you want to unlock.

    For more information about how to find a user in Identity Authentication, see [Search Users](search-users-06078a6.md).

2.  Select the user that you want to unlock.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can only unlock locked user TOTP passcodes.

3.  Choose the *Authentication* tab.

4.  Choose *Multi-Factor Authentication*.

5.  Press *Unlock* under *Passcode Status*.

    The system displays the message ***Account <name of user\> unlocked***.
