# SAP Concur

Follow this procedure to set up SAP Concur as a source system.



## Prerequisites

> ### Restriction:  
> This system is available for bundle tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure and standalone tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure and SAP BTP, Neo environment. Bundle tenants running on Neo environment can use it only through **SAP Jam Collaboration** and **SAP Identity Access Governance** bundle options.

-   You are using User v1 API, Identity v4 API or SCIM v4 API.

    > ### Note:  
    > The **User v1 API** has been decommissioned. For more information, see [Concur User API Decommission](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/FAQ_Concur_USER_EXTERNAL.pdf).

-   Your SAP Concur admin user has obtained a *Company Request Token* and a *Company UUID* from the SAP Concur Company Request Token self-service tool.

    For more information, see [SAP Concur Company Request Token](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CONCUR/83c94f03f949423a8f76158375832747/1b9040cf6caf1014a483f58a84015038.html).

## Context

Companies that use SAP Concur for managing and controlling travel expenses, invoices and other can use Identity Provisioning service to automate the identity and access management for the SAP Concur solution. This service allows you to read identity data from SAP Concur and provision it to a target system of your choice \(corporate user stores or SAP cloud user stores\).

SAP Concur provides different APIs for integration with Identity Provisioning, resulting in different connector versions. Each connector version supports specific attribute mappings within the transformations and requires particular property values. The value of the `concur.api.version` property controls which API you use.

-   When the value is set to `3`, the SCIM v4 API is used. It supports reading of users and groups.

    By default, the Identity Provisioning service uses version 3 for all newly created systems starting December 2, 2025, when version 3 was introduced. The default version is the latest released connector version at the time the system is created.

-   When the value is set to `2`, the Identity v4 API is used. This applies to systems created between December 8, 2021, and December 1, 2025. Identity v4 API supports provisioning of users with the `userUUID` attribute, which is generated by Identity Authentication at user creation.

-   When the value is set to `1`, or the property is not defined, the User v1 API is used. This applies to systems created before versioning was introduced on December 8, 2021. Version 1 is deprecated.


For more information on how to update to the connector version you need, see: [Update Connector Version](Operation-Guide/update-connector-version-8558733.md).

To create SAP Concur as a source system, proceed as follows:



<a name="loio209ea8281e6d49b28d85f87e5b2120fe__steps_hr4_myx_rdb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Bundle Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/7ab5884ffbc44461a57622d2f633e57c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning UI when the service is bundled as part of an SAP cloud solution's license.") :arrow_upper_right:
    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

2.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Source Systems*.

3.  Add *SAP Concur* as a source system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

4.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your Identity Provisioning tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

    When **set in the source system**, the prefix will be prepended to the name of the groups that are read from the SAP Concur source system and will be provisioned to the target system with the following name pattern: `Concur_<GroupDisplayName>`. This way SAP Concur groups in the target system will be distinguished from groups provisioned from other applications.

5.  Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *SAP Concur* source system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules to reflect your current setup of entities in your SAP Concur source system. For more information, see:

6.  Now, add a target system to provision users into it. Choose from: [Target Systems](target-systems-ab3f641.md)




<a name="loio209ea8281e6d49b28d85f87e5b2120fe__postreq_wss_rpj_p1b"/>

## Next Steps

-   Before starting a provisioning job, you can first subscribe for e-mail notifications from the source system you use in your scenario. This way, you will be notified by e-mail about eventual failed entities during the jobs. For more information, see [Manage Job Notifications](Monitoring-and-Reporting/manage-job-notifications-d055bc2.md).
-   Start an identity provisioning job. For more information, see [Monitor Provisioning Job Logs](Monitoring-and-Reporting/monitor-provisioning-job-logs-e5b5176.md).
