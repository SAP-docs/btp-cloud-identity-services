# SAP Concur

Follow this procedure to set up SAP Concur as a proxy system.



<a name="loio6abb966213e04c8fb4de05d4c5abfadc__prereq_dfj_ps4_vdb"/>

## Prerequisites

> ### Restriction:  
> This system is available for bundle tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure and standalone tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure and SAP BTP, Neo environment. Bundle tenants running on Neo environment can use it only through **SAP Jam Collaboration** and **SAP Identity Access Governance** bundle options.

You are using **User v1 API** or **Identity v4 API**

-   You have an SAP Concur admin user with *Web Services Administrator* role assigned.

-   Your SAP Concur admin user has obtained a *Company Request Token* and a *Company UUID* from the SAP Concur Company Request Token self-service tool.

    For more information, see [SAP Concur Company Request Token](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CONCUR/83c94f03f949423a8f76158375832747/1b9040cf6caf1014a483f58a84015038.html).


> ### Note:  
> The **User v1 API** is deprecated and will be decommissioned. For more information, see [Concur User API Decommission](https://assets.concur.com/concurtraining/cte/en-us/FAQ_Concur_USER_EXTERNAL.pdf).

> ### Note:  
> Administrators of bundle tenants on Neo environment should enable the *Manage OAuth Clients* permission, as described in *Neo Environment* section in [Manage Authorizations](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/544de9b504214372b4479dc1f6b08cca.html "Manage the authorizations of Identity Provisioning administrators, when your bundle or standalone tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment.") :arrow_upper_right:.

## Context

Companies that use SAP ConcurIdentity Provisioning service to automate the identity and access management for the SAP Concur solution. You can use SAP Concur as a proxy connector to execute *hybrid* scenarios. That means, it can provision its entities to another \(external\) back-end system by request, and then can continue executing CRUD operations back to SAP Concur, whenever the external back-end requests such. This scenario supports reading and writing of **users**.

The SAP Concur integration with Identity Provisioning is supported with Standard and Professional editions.

SAP Concur provides User v1 API and Identity v4 API. The value of the `concur.api.version` property controls which API you use.

-   When the value is set to `1`, or the property is not defined \(typical for systems created before versioning was introduced on December 8, 2021\), User v1 API is used. Version 1 is deprecated. For more information on how to update to version 2, see: [Update Connector Version](Operation-Guide/update-connector-version-8558733.md)

-   When the value is set to `2`, Identity v4 API is used. This is the value that Identity Provisioning automatically sets for newly created systems after versioning was introduced on December 8, 2021. Identity v4 API supports provisioning of users with userUUID attribute which is generated by Identity Authentication at user creation.


To create SAP Concur as a proxy system, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Open your subaccount in SAP BTP cockpit \(valid for OAuth authentication to the Identity Provisioning proxy system\).

    > ### Note:  
    > If you have a bundle tenant, then in the cockpit → *Neo* → *Overview*, you can see the Global account, which SAP provides for your bundle in the corresponding Identity Provisioning region. Then, in the global account, you can see your subaccount, where the Identity Provisioning is enabled as a service for the bundle. The display name of the subaccount starts with **SAP\_BUNDLE**.

2.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Users & Authorizations* \> *Administrators*.

3.  Create a technical user with the necessary authorizations. It will later be used by the external consumer to connect to Identity Provisioning.

    -   For **Certificate-based authentication**, follow the procedure in [Manage Certificates for Inbound Connection](Operation-Guide/manage-certificates-for-inbound-connection-952e7c7.md) → *SAP BTP, Neo Environment*

    -   For **OAuth authentication**, proceed as follows:

        1.  Go to *Security* \> *OAuth* \> *Clients* and choose *Register New Client*.

        2.  From the *Subscription* combo box, select **<provider\_subaccount\>/ipsproxy**.

        3.  From the *Authorization Grant* combo box, select **Client Credentials**.

        4.  In the *Secret* field, enter a password \(client secret\) and remember it. You will need it later, for the repository configuration in the external system.

        5.  Copy/paste and save \(in a notepad\) the generated *Client ID*. You will need it later, too.

        6.  From the left-side navigation, choose *Subscriptions* \> *Java Applications* \> *ipsproxy* .

        7.  From the left-side navigation, choose *Roles* \> *IPS\_PROXY\_USER*.

        8.  Choose *Assign* and enter **oauth\_client\_<client\_ID\>**.

            For *<client\_ID\>*, enter the one you have saved in the previous main step.


    -   For **Certificate-based authentication**, upload the certificate for the technical user of type *System*, as described in [Add System as Administrator](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/add-administrators?version=Cloud#add-system-as-administrator) and enable the *Access Proxy System API* permission.

    -   For **Basic authentication**, proceed as follows:

        1.  Add an administrator user of type **System** and configure the basic authentication method for this user.

            If you already have a technical user, skip this step.

        2.  Save your changes.

        3.  Select your administrator user of type **System** and enable the *Access Proxy System API* permission.

        4.  Save your changes.



4.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Bundle Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/7ab5884ffbc44461a57622d2f633e57c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning UI when the service is bundled as part of an SAP cloud solution's license.") :arrow_upper_right:
    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

5.  Add *SAP Concur* as a proxy system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

6.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your Identity Provisioning tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

    > ### Note:  
    > The Identity Provisioning implementation of the Proxy System SCIM API \(based on the [SCIM Query](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2)\) supports single entity and delta read filtering for users. For more information, see [Query Parameters for Proxy System SCIM API](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-provisioning/identity-provisioning/proxy-systems?version=Cloud#query-parameters-for-proxy-scim-api).

7.  Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *SAP Concur* proxy system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules to reflect your current setup of entities in your SAP Concur. For more information, see:

    [Manage Transformations](Operation-Guide/manage-transformations-2d0fbe5.md)

    [SAP Business Accelerator Hub: Concur \(Users\)](https://api.sap.com/api/ConcurExpenseUsers/resource)

    **UPS v1 API**: [User v1](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/user/index.html)

    **Identity v4 API**: [Identity v4](https://developer.concur.com/api-reference/profile/v4.identity.html)

    > ### Caution:  
    > The User v1 API requires an initial password setup for all newly provisioned user accounts. The default transformation offers a statement with an empty string as a value for the password configuration. However, it is ignored in order to prevent from a default setup of a wrong initial password for your systems. While the password statement is ignored, the provisioning will not be working. To enable the provisioning to SAP Concur, you need to perform the following operations:
    > 
    > 1.  Enable the password statement. To do this, either delete **"ignore": true,** or set it as **"ignore": false**.
    > 2.  Set a proper statement for the password attribute value \(**"targetPath": "$.Password"**\).
    > 
    > \(Optional\) You can leave the default empty string, or you can use the **randomPassword** function to calculate a random value for the initial password of the newly created SAP Concur accounts. If you choose one of these two options and if you are not using single sign-on solution for SAP Concur, you have to also arrange a password reset support process in your company. This will securely offer an initial password to your corporate users for their newly created SAP Concur accounts. For more information, see [Transformation Expressions](transformation-expressions-bb8537b.md) → **Transformation Functions**.

    **Default read and write transformation when using User v1 API \(Version 1\):**

    > ### Tip:  
    > The proxy *Read Transformation* is used when the external client application \(for example, SAP Identity Management\) makes initial load. That is, executing GET requests to the resource endpoints \(**/Users** or **/Groups**\) to retrieve the corresponding entities of the particular type. The external client application can also execute GET requests to a single resource endpoint \(querying a single resource is supported\). In this case, the proxy system acts as a *source* one.
    > 
    > The proxy *Write Transformation* is used when the external application manages the entities in the proxy system – creates new entities, updates existing ones, or deletes existing ones. In this case, the proxy system acts as a *target* one.
    > 
    > However, after a *Create* or *Update* operation is performed on the proxy system, the *Read Transformation* is applied to the result, so that the created or updated entity is sent back to the external application. This behavior demonstrates that the proxy *Read Transformation* is used for *write* cases, as well.

    The Identity Provisioning does not provide group resource mapping in the SAP Concur write transformation. Although you cannot provision groups to SAP Concur, you can group the users into organizational units by enhancing your target transformation. For more information, see: [SAP Concur \(Target System\)](sap-concur-032fd80.md)

8.  Connect the external consumer to Identity Provisioning with the technical user you have created in step 2.

    If the external consumer system is **SAP Identity Management**, you can export the newly created proxy system as a SCIM repository from Identity Provisioning and import it in SAP Identity Management. This will create a SCIM repository in SAP Identity Management where most of the repository constants will be automatically filled in. You need to provide the technical user credentials that you have set up in step 2 and the SCIM assignment method as described below:

    -   For AUTH\_USER and AUTH\_PASSWORD, enter your client ID and secret.

    -   For the SCIM\_ASSIGNMENT\_METHOD constant, make sure the value is **PUT**.


    -   For AUTH\_USER and AUTH\_PASSWORD, enter the user ID and password of the Identity Authentication technical user for which you have set permission *Access Proxy System API*.

    -   For the SCIM\_ASSIGNMENT\_METHOD constant, make sure the value is **PUT**.


    > ### Note:  
    > For external consumer systems, other than SAP Identity Management, you should also use the **PUT** method for modifying entities.

## Next Steps

When a proxy system is connected to an external backend system \(in the case of SAP Identity Management this means the exported CSV file is imported into the Identity Management Admin UI and a repository is configured\), you can start managing the users and groups into this external system. Usually, the first operation is the initial load of the existing entities into your external system. When this load has finished, changes in the external system, such as creating new users or updating existing ones, can trigger CRUD requests back to the proxy system.

To see an example with SAP Identity Management, see [Hybrid Scenario: SAP Identity Management](Integrating-the-Service/hybrid-scenario-sap-identity-management-6fa419a.md) → sections **Next Steps** and **Future Identity Lifecycle**.
