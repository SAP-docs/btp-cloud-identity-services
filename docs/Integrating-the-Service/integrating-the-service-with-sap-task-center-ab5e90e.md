# Integrating the Service with SAP Task Center



<a name="loioab5e90ebb2914be9aa145494df048a32__section_unp_r3n_wqb"/>

## Overview

For the integration scenario of SAP Task Center, you must use the Global User ID of SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication as the federation identifier.

The Global User ID specifies an identifier for a user that is unique across technology layers such as user interface, APIs, and security tokens, as well as across products and lines of businesses contributing to a business process in the Intelligent Enterprise.

This attribute is automatically generated by Identity Authentication at user creation, and it can be changed by the admin after that. It can be provisioned to various SAP cloud solutions by Identity Provisioning.

> ### Remember:  
> When Identity Authentication uses a corporate identity provider \(IdP\) to authenticate the users, the *Enable the Use Identity Authentication user store* option under the *Identity Federation* configuration of the corporate IdP must be enabled, and the users must exist in the Identity Directory, the local user store of Identity Authentication.

The Global User ID addresses the challenge of integrating user-related data across system boundaries. SAP Task Center is an example of a service, which requires the use of the Global User ID as a common user identifier. SAP Task Center provides a single entry point for business users to access their tasks. This scenario needs an enterprise-wide mapping of users to relate tasks to each other in different systems.

> ### Note:  
> Use the Global User ID as a common user identifier for SAP if you expect to use applications, which require one identifier in all solutions like SAP Task Center. For more information, see [System Integration Guide for SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Task Center](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b95c3d5bab324a3a8409eee5267a5b75/Cloud/en-US/27947dfb325047018603446439050a6b.html).

## Usage



### Identity Authentication

For every newly created user \(self-registered, imported, or manually created - via the administration console or API\), Identity Authentication generates a Global User ID. It is unique and can be changed later by the tenant administrator.

The system generated attribute value is 36 characters long \(32 hexadecimal characters and 4 hyphens\).

> ### Example:  
> f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6

This attribute can be sent from Identity Authentication to applications as a user attribute, `Subject Name Identifier`, and default attribute in the SAML assertion. The Global User ID is also put in the `id_token` if the application uses OpenID connect.



### Identity Provisioning

Identity Provisioning supports provisioning users with Global User ID for the following SAP cloud solutions:

-   SAP Ariba

-   SAP Fieldglass

-   SAP SuccessFactors

-   SAP S/4HANA Cloud

-   SAP S/4HANA through SAP Application Server ABAP

-   SAP Marketing Cloud

-   SAP Integrated Business Planning for Supply Chain

-   SAP BTP ABAP Environment


> ### Note:  
> In the context of SAP Task Center, those solutions are known as SAP task providers. For more information about the availability of the SAP task provider solutions integrated with SAP Task Center, refer to SAP Note: [2977611](https://me.sap.com/notes/2977611).

The Global User ID is provisioned by the Identity Provisioning using the SCIM attribute `userUuid` as part of the `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:sap:2.0:User` namespace.



### SAP Identity Management

SAP Identity Management \(on-premise solution\) supports reading users with Global User ID from Identity Authentication using the Identity Management *SCI* connector. SCI stands for SAP Cloud Identity, the former name of Identity Authentication. It is not possible to use the Identity Management SCIM connector in a hybrid scenario with Identity Provisioning for that purpose.

Once loaded in SAP Identity Management, users with Global User ID can be provisioned to SAP S/4HANA on-premise systems only. In this case, the Identity Management *ABAP* or *BusinessSuite* connectors are used.

When SAP Identity Management provisions a new user to Identity Authentication, the Global User ID is generated by the service and returned back as a response. It is stored in the Identity Management MX\_USER\_UUID attribute.

For more information on how to provision the Global User ID from your SAP Identity Management system to your SAP S/4HANA on-premise system, refer to SAP Note [3047993](https://me.sap.com/notes/3047993).
