The integration between SAP Web IDE Full-Stack and Identity Authentication enables users to access SAP Web IDE Full-Stack with their Identity Authentication credentials.

SAP Web IDE Full-Stack access is protected by permissions. To grant a user the permission to access a protected resource, you can assign one of the predefined roles to such a permission. The following predefined roles are available:

-   ***DiDeveloper*** - To develop with SAP Web IDE Full-Stack, the DiDeveloper role needs to be assigned.

-   ***DiAdministrator*** - To be able to manage user data, a user has to be assigned to the DiAdministrator role.

-   ***DiScpGitAdministrator***- To be able to manage Git repositories, a user has to be assigned to the DiScpGitAdministrator role.


> ### Remember:  
> You should use the ***DiDeveloper*** or ***DiAdministrator*** role to enable users to access SAP Web IDE Full-Stack with their Identity Authentication credentials. For more information, see [Assign DiDeveloper or DiAdministrator Roles](integrating-the-service-with-sap-web-ide-full-stack-313f545.md#loioa0b0ae9fea034ff5823bc0a5b0520cd4).
