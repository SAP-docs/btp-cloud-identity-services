# Configure Trust with SAML 2.0 Corporate Identity Provider

This document is intended to help you configure trust with a SAML 2.0 corporate identity provider.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> If an application requires force authentication \(ForceAuthn="true"\), users have to authenticate themselves against the corporate identity provider each time they access the application even if single sign-on \(SSO\) is enabled.

To configure trust with the SAML 2.0 corporate identity provider, follow the procedures below:

<a name="task_jlj_2rm_qgb"/>

<!-- task\_jlj\_2rm\_qgb -->

## 1. Configure Trust on the Corporate Identity Provider Side

Set up trust with Identity Authentication as a service provider.



<a name="task_jlj_2rm_qgb__prereq_pyl_55m_qgb"/>

## Prerequisites

You have the SAML 2.0 metadata of Identity Authentication. For more information how to download the metadata, see [Tenant SAML 2.0 Configurations](../Operation-Guide/tenant-saml-2-0-configurations-e81a19b.md).



<a name="task_jlj_2rm_qgb__steps_syl_55m_qgb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Register Identity Authentication as a service provider at the corporate identity provider.

    > ### Remember:  
    > If you want to use IdP-initiated single sign-on \(SSO\) from your corporate identity provider, you have to add the parameter `sp=<sp_name>` to the assertion consumer service \(ACS\) endpoint configured on your corporate identity provider side for Identity Authentication.
    > 
    > > ### Example:  
    > > https://<the current ACS endpoint URL\>?sp=<sp\_name\>\>
    > > 
    > > `sp` is the name of the SAML 2 service provider for which SSO is performed.
    > 
    > To see how to download the SAML 2.0 metadata of Identity Authentication read [Tenant SAML 2.0 Configurations](../Operation-Guide/tenant-saml-2-0-configurations-e81a19b.md).

2.  **Optional:** Download the corporate identity provider SAML 2.0 metadata.

    You need the corporate SAML 2.0 metadata for the setup of the trust on Identity Authentication. Optionally, you can make the configurations manually.

## 2. Configure Trust on Identity Authentication Side

Set up trust with your corporate identity provider in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.



<a name="task_rkw_frm_qgb__prereq_z15_55m_qgb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You are assigned the *Manage Corporate Identity Providers* role. For more information about how to assign administrator roles, see [Edit Administrator Authorizations](../Operation-Guide/edit-administrator-authorizations-86ee374.md).

-   You have registered Identity Authentication as service provider at the corporate identity provider.

-   You have the corporate identity provider SAML 2.0 metadata.




<a name="task_rkw_frm_qgb__steps_cb5_55m_qgb"/>

## Procedure

1.  Sign in to the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.

2.  Under *Identity Providers*, choose the *Corporate Identity Providers* tile.

3.  Select the corporate identity provider that you want to configure.

    > ### Tip:  
    > If you need to change the protocol, see [Choose Identity Provider Type](../Operation-Guide/choose-identity-provider-type-0838379.md)..

4.  Under *SAML 2.0*, choose *SAML 2.0 Configuration*.

5.  Upload the corporate identity provider metadata XML file or manually enter the communication settings negotiated between Identity Authentication and the identity provider.

    > ### Note:  
    > Use a file with an extension `.xml`.

    When the identity provider metadata is uploaded, the fields are populated automatically with the parsed data from the XML file. The minimum configuration is to complete the *Name* field, add at least one single sign-on endpoint, and provide a signing certificate.

    You can add up to two signing certificates. Both signing certificates are accepted according to the certificate validity.

6.  **Optional:** Choose the digest algorithm for signing outgoing messages from the dropdown list in the *Algorithm* section. You have the following options:

    -   *SHA-1* 
    -   *SHA-256* - the default option

        > ### Remember:  
        > The algorithm must be *SHA-256* if the Identity provider type is set at *Microsoft ADFS / Entra ID*.

    -   *SHA-512*

7.  **Optional:** Enable or disable the *Include scoping* attribute to include or exclude the Scoping element in the SAML 2.0 request.

    > ### Remember:  
    > The default setting for the *Include scoping* is enabled. The Scoping element sent in the SAML 2.0 request is 1.
    > 
    > If the identity provider type is set at *Microsoft ADFS / Entra ID* the default setting for the *Include scoping* is disabled and the Scoping element is not sent in the SAML 2.0 request.

8.  Save your selection.

    Once the identity provider has been updated, the system displays the message ***Identity provider <name of identity provider\> updated***.
