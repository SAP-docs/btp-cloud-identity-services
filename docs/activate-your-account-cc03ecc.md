# Activate Your Account

Open the email from your SAP team and follow the instructions to activate your account.

The first person who gets an account activation email for the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services is the initial admin user.

-   If your tenant is obtained as part of a bundle with an SAP cloud solution, **the technical contact person** \(also known as Contact Person IT\) of the customer receives an email with the tenant URL. He or she is granted the administrator permissions of the tenant and performs the initial logon.

    In addition, the technical contact person receives an email from the team of the bundled SAP cloud solution. It contains the tenant URL of the cloud solution and may contain the tenant URL of SAP Cloud Identity Services.

    > ### Note:  
    > When a customer with existing SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant purchases more bundled SAP cloud solutions, no new tenants are created and the existing one is reused.
    > 
    > -   If the contact person of the customer has a user account in this existing tenant, no account activation email is sent. This person can access the SAP Cloud Identity Services - Tenants application at the following URL: [https://iamtenants.accounts.cloud.sap/](https://iamtenants.accounts.cloud.sap/) and check the customer tenants and administrators.
    > 
    > -   If the contact person of the customer has no user account in this existing tenant, and such an account is needed by the solution \(application\), he or she is created as a regular user and receives an account activation email for the user profile. This user doesn't get access to the admin console unless an administrator grants him or her the necessary permissions.

-   If your tenant is obtained as part of the self-service request, **the logged-in user in SAP BTP cockpit** is granted the administrator permissions of the tenant. He or she receives the account activation email and performs the initial logon.

    > ### Note:  
    > When a customer with existing SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant subscribes to the Cloud Identity Services default plan in SAP BTP cockpit, no new tenant is created and the existing one is reused. The logged-in user doesn't receive an email notification.
