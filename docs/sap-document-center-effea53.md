# SAP Document Center

Follow this procedure to set up SAP Document Center as a target system.



<a name="loioeffea539fb6448f188e773ef9032eb2c__prereq_rl2_ldn_cbb"/>

## Prerequisites

> ### Restriction:  
> This system is available for bundle tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure and standalone tenants running on SAP Cloud Identity infrastructure and SAP BTP, Neo environment. Bundle tenants running on Neo environment can use it only through **SAP Identity Access Governance** bundle option.

-   You have an SAP Business Technology Platform user with administration rights for the tenant.
-   You have enabled the SAP Document Center service in the cockpit.



## Context

SAP Document Center offers programs \(apps\) that can be downloaded and run on multiple independent devices. For more information, see [SAP Document Center](https://help.sap.com/viewer/p/SAP_Document_Center).

It plays the role of a content service for your SAP Business Technology Platform subaccount. To use it as a target system for writing users, follow the procedure below.



## Procedure

1.  Assign your SAP Business Technology Platform user **admin** rights for SAP Document Center. To do this, open the *SAP Document Center* service tile \(in the cockpit\), open link *Assign Roles & Set Destinations*, choose *Administrator*, and then â€“ *Assign*.

2.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

3.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Target Systems*.

4.  Add *SAP Document Center* as a target system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

5.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

    Use this property to control the number of groups to be deleted in a target system by defining a threshold. This will prevent you from accidentally deleting a huge number of groups, for example by adding a filter or condition.

    To learn what additional properties are relevant to this system, see [List of Properties](list-of-properties-d6f3577.md). You can use the main search, or filter properties by the *Name* or *System Type* columns.

6.  \(Optional\) Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *SAP Document Center* target system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules to reflect your current setup of entities in your SAP Document Center. For more information, see:

    [Manage Transformations](Operation-Guide/manage-transformations-2d0fbe5.md)

    **Default transformation:**

    >                 "targetPath": "$.lastName"
    >             },
    >             {
    >                 "sourcePath": "$.emails[0].value",
    >                 "optional": true,
    >                 "targetPath": "$.email"

    >                 "targetPath": "$.logonId"
    >             }
    >         ]
    >     }
    > }
    > 
    > ```

7.  Now, add a source system from which to read users. Choose from: [Source Systems](source-systems-58033be.md)

## Next Steps

-   Before starting a provisioning job, you can first subscribe for e-mail notifications from the source system you use in your scenario. This way, you will be notified by e-mail about eventual failed entities during the jobs. For more information, see [Manage Job Notifications](Monitoring-and-Reporting/manage-job-notifications-d055bc2.md).
-   Now, start an identity provisioning job. For more information, see [Monitor Provisioning Job Logs](Monitoring-and-Reporting/monitor-provisioning-job-logs-e5b5176.md).
