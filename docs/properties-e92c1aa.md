# Properties

Properties hold the configuration of a provisioning system.

Properties define the connection and authentication information needed for accessing the provisioning system. They control which entities \(users and groups\) will be provisioned - by defining filters and unique attributes, as well as how they will be provisioned - in bulk operations or one entity at a time, with put or patch requests.

There are various types of properties depending on their usability, whether they hold mandatory or optional information, standard information in plain text or credentials in encrypted strings. They can be categorized as follows:

-   Standard

-   Credential

-   Default

-   Parameterized

-   Internal


For your system provisioning goals, you can set properties in SAP BTP cockpit: *Destinations* andthe administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services on the *Properties* tab of the provisioning system.

> ### Note:  
> If the same properties exist in both the *Destinations* editor \(in the cockpit\) and in the *Properties* tab of the system \(in the Identity Provisioning UI\), the values set in the *Properties* tab are taken with higher priority.

## Prefixes



Property names have specific prefixes that indicate the provisioning system they are applicable to. This helps you differentiate between properties designated for different systems.

-   Properties starting with *<ips\>* are applicable to all provisioning systems, for example `ips.failed.request.retry.attempts`.

-   Properties starting with the abbreviation of a provisioning system name, such as *<s4hana.cloud\>* or *<sf\>*, are applicable to the respective systemsâ€”in this case, SAP S/4HANA Cloud and SAP SuccessFactors, respectively. For example, `s4hana.cloud.support.bulk.operation` and `sf.user.filter`.

-   Properties starting with *<scim\>* are applicable to SCIM-based provisioning systems. To view the list of these systems, refer to [System Types](system-types-e59ae54.md). The scim-prefixed properties were used before the implementation of system-specific prefixes. Following the introduction of these prefixes, both scim and system-specific prefixes are valid.


> ### Note:  
> The scim-prefixed properties and the system-specific properties can be used interchangeably. If both are configured, Identity Provisioning will prioritize and consider the system-specific properties.
