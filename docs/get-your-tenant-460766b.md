<a name="loio460766b1b08d48a0b4adfb230c60a001__section_dvt_zsx_zyb"/>

## Prerequisites

Check if there is a tenant assigned to your customer ID by accessing the SAP Cloud Identity Services - Tenants application at [https://iamtenants.accounts.cloud.sap/](https://iamtenants.accounts.cloud.sap/). For more information, see [Viewing Assigned Tenants and Administrators](https://help.sap.com/viewer/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/Cloud/en-US/f56e6f24e373404087d6a1a9a13515a2.html).

-   If there is an existing tenant and you are among its administrators, skip this step and go to [Access Admin Console](access-admin-console-2609e81.md).

-   If there is no existing tenant, follow the steps below to get one according to your needs.

## Context

An SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant is delivered to customers as part of a bundle with an SAP cloud solution or as part of a self-service request in SAP BTP cockpit.



### Bundle with an SAP Cloud Solution

When you purchase an SAP cloud solution that bundles SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication and Identity Provisioning, you are entitled to one productive and one test tenant. Depending on the cloud solution, SAP can create and provision to your organization only one productive tenant, only one test tenant or both productive and test tenant.

If you already have a bundle tenant and you purchase more SAP cloud solutions, you won't get additional tenants. Your existing one will be reused. The only exception to this rule is if your current tenant cannot be used due to some restrictions and legal requirements, like data residency regulations. For example, it is required that the user data should not leave a particular region or country. In that case, a new tenant is created in the new region.

Tenants delivered as part of the bundling process are created automatically. You get their tenant URLs in a welcome e-mail from SAP.

> ### Note:  
> In the case of SAP SuccessFactors, getting a bundle tenant requires you to initiate an upgrade to SAP Cloud Identity Services in SAP SuccessFactors Upgrade Center. For more information see: [Initiating the Upgrade to SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Authentication Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_SUCCESSFACTORS_PLATFORM/568fdf1f14f14fd089a3cd15194d19cc/0271d9c4176e45ca9307e49230073240.html?version=2305).

For more information, see [Bundles](bundles-25b65a4.md).



### Self-Service Request in SAP BTP Cockpit

Products delivered on SAP Business Technology Platform \(SAP BTP\) does not trigger automatic creation of SAP Cloud Identity Services productive and test tenant. You need to request the tenant in the SAP BTP cockpit.

This is true in most cases, but not for all SAP BTP applications, and depends on the subaccount where the application runs on. In SAP BTP, there are customer-managed and SAP-managed subaccounts.

-   If the application runs on SAP-managed subaccount, then the SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant is automatically provisioned with the application. In this case, the administrator of the customer doesn't have access to the SAP BTP subaccount.

-   If the application runs on customer-managed subaccount, then in most cases the administrator of the customer has to manually create SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant via SAP BTP cockpit. However, there are also exceptions, like SAP Cloud ALM \(application lifecycle management\), where SAP creates and provisions the Identity Authentication tenant.


Additional tenants and trial tenants are also created through self-service request.



### 

> ### Note:  
> Although bundled and self-requested tenants differ in the way you get them, from technical and functional perspective they have no differences.

> ### Note:  
> Be aware that it will take some time until the tenant becomes accessible. If you try to access the tenant right after creating it, you will receive ***Error 404 Not Found***.

For more information, see [Tenants](tenants-93160eb.md).

## Get Productive and Test Tenant

Get your productive and test tenant as part of a self-service request in SAP BTP cockpit. Productive and test tenants have no difference from technical and functional perspective.



### Prerequisites

-   You have a global account in SAP BTP cockpit with a multi-environment subaccount.




### Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, choose your subaccount and navigate to *Entitlements* \> *Edit* \> *Add Service Plans*.

2.  In the pop-up dialog, select *Cloud Identity Services*.

3.  Select the *default \(Application\)* service plan, and then choose *Add Service Plan*.

4.  Save your changes on the *Entitlements* page.

5.  Navigate to *Services* \> *Service Marketplace* and select the *Cloud Identity Services* tile. Under *Application Plans* you should see the *default* plan.

6.  In the top-right corner, choose *Create* and follow the steps in the wizard to configure your new Cloud Identity Services tenant:

    1.  From the dropdown list, choose *Cloud Identity Services*.

    2.  Select the *default* plan and then choose *Next*.

    3.  From the *Cloud Service Type* dropdown, choose the tenant type: *Test* or *Productive* \(default value\).

    4.  Choose *Next*, review your configuration and choose *Create*.


    > ### Note:  
    > For each service plan you must have a separate subaccount.
    > 
    > The default plan allows you to consume SAP Cloud Identity Services. New tenants are created only if there aren't already existing tenants of the same type \(productive or test\) bound to your customer ID, regardless of the region.
    > 
    > The default test and productive tenants will be created in the same region.

    > ### Caution:  
    > If you unsubscribe the *default* plan, the Identity Authentication tenant is deactivated, if not used by other orders or products.

7.  If you initially create a test tenant and then you want to proceed with a productive one \(or vice versa\), repeat the steps above in a separate subaccount of the same region.




### 

> ### Note:  
> **SAP BTP, Neo subaccount**
> 
> If you have a global account with Neo subaccount, you can get a productive tenant and use it for free under the [General Terms and Conditions for SAP Cloud Services](https://www.sap.com/about/trust-center/agreements/cloud/cloud-services.html?sort=latest_desc&search=General%20Terms%20and%20Conditions). For this, you need to open your Neo subaccount, navigate to *Services* \> *Identity Authentication* tile and enable the service. The new tenants are created only if there aren't existing productive tenants bound to your customer ID already.

## Get Additional Tenant

Get an additional tenant as part of a self-service request in SAP BTP cockpit. SAP customers and partners can use SAP Cloud Identity Services additional tenants via CPEA \(Cloud Platform Enterprise Agreement\) and Pay-As-You-Go consumption-based commercial models. They can request one additional tenant per SAP BTP subaccount.

> ### Note:  
> The additional tenant doesnâ€™t add additional logon requests. Licensed logon requests are distributed across all tenants.



### Prerequisites

-   You have a global account in SAP BTP cockpit with a multi-environment subaccount.




### Procedure

To get additional tenant using SAP BTP multi-environment subaccount, proceed as follows:

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, choose your subaccount and navigate to *Services* \> *Service Marketplace*.

2.  Select the *Cloud Identity Services* tile.

    > ### Tip:  
    > -   If you don't see the *Cloud Identity Service* tile, navigate to *Entitlements* trial, add the tile.

    > -   If you use directories entitlement management in your global account, you must assign the *additional-tenant* plan to the directory first, and after that to the subaccount. Once you assign the *additional-tenant* plan to your directory, it will appear in your subaccount entitlements too. For more information, see [Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Directories](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/37f8871865114f44aebee3db6ac64b72.html).

    > ### Note:  
    > For each service plan you must have a separate subaccount.
    > 
    > The *additional-tenant* plan allows the customer to create a new SAP Cloud Identity Services additional tenant. The type of the created tenant may be test or productive depending on the customer selection. The new instance is created only if there is an existing default instance bound to your customer ID.
    > 
    > You can remove that additional tenant for the subaccount by choosing the *Delete* button. Please note that the tenant is deleted immediately.

3.  Choose *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions*.

> 
> Identity Authentication additional productive tenant will be created and the account member who triggered the creation will get an activation email. Note that test tenants cannot be created from a Neo subaccount.
> 
> If you decide to remove that additional tenant for the subaccount by choosing the *Delete* button, note that the tenant is deleted immediately.

## Get Trial Tenant

Create a trial tenant from an SAP BTP trial account.

A trial tenant is intended for testing purposes. It allows you to try out and explore SAP Cloud Identity Services â€“ Identity Authentication and Identity Provisioning. It is free of charge and limited to a trial period in accordance with the [SAP BTP trial terms and conditions](https://accounts.sap.com/ui/public/viewTextResource?scenario=1b5ff22b-ac85-466f-9644-833d07e77d5e&resourceType=RESOURCE_TERMS_OF_USE&locale=en_US). A trial tenant differs from a test tenant. Trial tenants can be used for a limited period, while test tenants are provided to customers in addition to their productive tenants where they can test new features before implementing them productively.

> ### Restriction:  
> -   You can have only one trial tenant per SAP BTP global account regardless of how many subaccounts you create. If you have multiple subaccounts, and you've got trial tenants for them, the subaccounts will use one and the same trial tenant.
> 
> -   You can have up to 50 users in a trial tenant.
> 
> -   You can't connect to on-premise systems using the cloud connector. It's not possible to subscribe to the Cloud Identity Services connectivity plan in your trial subaccount.
