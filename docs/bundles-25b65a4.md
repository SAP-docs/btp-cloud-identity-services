# Bundles

A bundle is a group of preconfigured products and services which are sold together.

SAP Cloud Identity Services refer to a bundle as a group of preconfigured SAP cloud solutions and Cloud Identity Services. You purchase the cloud solution and get the services free of charge. The reason for bundling is to offer you out-of-the-box integration between SAP solutions.

> ### Note:  
> As a customer, you need at least one licensed SAP cloud solution which triggers SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant delivery.

The bundling process results in provisioning an SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant to your organization, where Identity Authentication and Identity Provisioning are preconfigured for the relevant SAP cloud solution. In the majority of cases, this means that in the SAP Cloud Identity Services admin console, a bundled application is created and connected to the cloud solution, where your users will log on. The trust between Identity Authentication and the given solution is established.

For Identity Provisioning, this means that communication and authentication with the provisioning systems relevant for the SAP cloud solution are set up. The transformations of those systems might be different from the default ones and adapted for specific scenarios. You are ready to schedule and run jobs to synchronize your users and groups.

Note that all provisioning systems \(connectors\) are enabled for the SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance bundle tenant, and all source and proxy connectors are enabled for the SAP Jam Collaboration bundle tenant.

> ### Note:  
> Note the availability of the following connectors within the bundle tenants running in the infrastructure of SAP Cloud Identity Services:
> 
> -   SCIM, LDAP Server, Microsoft AD, Microsoft Entra ID and Google G suite are not supported as target connectors in bundle tenants.
> 
> -   Cloud Foundry UAA Server is not supported as source, target and proxy connector in bundle tenants.

> ### Note:  
> Some SAP cloud solutions bundle with Identity Authentication only. There could be various reasons for that. For example, the solution may not have a local user store and therefore doesn't need to bundle with Identity Provisioning for managing identity lifecycle. Or the provisioning service doesn't offer a connector to the given SAP cloud solution.
