<a name="loiofd6de3ccee3e4ca09ed49b6c7d8c0042__prereq_tcl_444_kfb"/>

## Prerequisites

> ### Note:  
> If you have purchased the Identity Provisioning service between **September 1, 2020** and **October 20, 2020**, and you want to make a connection to this on-premise system, follow the procedure in: [Connect to On-Premise Systems in SAP Cloud Identity Infrastructure](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/connect-to-on-premise-systems-in-sap-cloud-identity-infrastructure?version=Cloud).

-   You have installed the Cloud Connector in your corporate environment and have done the initial configuration. For more information, see: [Cloud Connector \(Neo\)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b865ed651e414196b39f8922db2122c7/Cloud/en-US/d751d065774e45e1b6bdbfdfd541da13.html)
-   You have technical credentials \(user and password\) for SAP S/4HANA on-premise.
-   The SAP S/4HANA on-premise system is version **1809** or higher.
-   You have configured your SOA Manager to directly call the following Web services:

    -   **ManageBusinessUserIn**
    -   **QueryBusinessUserIn**

    For more information, see: [Setting Up SOA Manager](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM/684cffda9cbc4187ad7dad790b03b983/e9c0c9faead44086b1d9a88da63bdaae.html?version=latest).

## Context

You can use Identity Provisioning to configure SAP S/4HANA on-premise as a target system where you can provision **users** from source systems.

This scenario requires that you first provision the users to SAP AS ABAP. The created ABAP users will have PFCG roles assigned. Once this is done, the users will have ABAP IDs. Then, after the provisioning to SAP S/4HANA on-premise, business users will be created and linked to the relevant ABAP IDs via the *User\_Assignment* attribute.

In SAP S/4HANA, a business user is defined as a natural person who is represented by a business partner and a link to a user in the system. Actually, the business user is an AS ABAP \(SU01\) user who also has a one-to-one relation to a corresponding business partner. For more information on the identity model for business users, see SAP Note [2570961](https://me.sap.com/notes/2570961).

SAP S/4HANA on-premise supports provisioning of users with *User UUID* attribute which is generated by Identity Authentication at user creation. The attribute mapping is handled by the default transformation of AS ABAP connector. For more information, see: [SAP Application Server ABAP](sap-application-server-abap-7a0c6e7.md).

Provisioning of **roles** \(considered as *groups*\) is also handled by the default transformation of SAP AS ABAP connector.

According to your use case, you can decide whether to use SAP S/4HANA on-premise with HR \(human resources\) integration active or not.

-   System with HR integration – When the HR integration is active, business users in SAP S/4HANA on-premise are automatically created and managed by the HR system \(for example, an external data source, such as an identity management system\). The Identity Provisioning service can manage only the user-related login information, such as date/time preferences, or role assignments.

    This means that once the users are provisioned to AS ABAP, you need to run the provisioning to SAP S/4HANA on-premise, so that business users \(employee, collaboration user, contingent worker, resource\) can be linked to the AS ABAP users via the *User\_Assignment* attribute.

    > ### Note:  
    > Identity Provisioning cannot delete business users in SAP S/4HANA Cloud on-premise system with active HR integration. Deletion is possible only in case of erroneous user assignments to business partners. For more information, see [2568251](https://me.sap.com/notes/2568251).

-   System without HR integration – lean business users will be created after the provisioning job, and the AS ABAP users will be linked to them. The Identity Provisioning service manages the complete set of **business partners** and their relevant **business users**.

To enable HR integration, you need to specify the relevant property in the system configuration. See **step 4** from the procedure below.

## Procedure

1.  Open the Cloud Connector to add an access control system mapping for **SAP S/4HANA On-Premise**. This is needed to allow the Identity Provisioning service to access SAP S/4HANA On-Premise as a back-end system on the intranet. To learn how, see: [Configure Access Control \(HTTP\)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b865ed651e414196b39f8922db2122c7/Cloud/en-US/e7d4927dbb571014af7ef6ebd6cc3511.html)

2.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Bundle Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/7ab5884ffbc44461a57622d2f633e57c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning UI when the service is bundled as part of an SAP cloud solution's license.") :arrow_upper_right:
    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

3.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Target Systems*.

4.  Add *SAP S/4HANA On-Premise* as a target system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

5.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

    If Identity Provisioning tries to provision a user that already exists in the SAP S/4HANA On-Premise target system \(a conflicting user\), this property defines the unique attributes by which the existing user will be searched and resolved.

    According to your use case, choose how to set up this property:

    -   Default behavior: This property does not appear in the UI during system creation. Its default value is *personExternalID*. That means, if the service finds an existing user by a *personExternalID*, it updates this user with the data of the conflicting one.

        If a user with such а *personExternalID* is not found, the creation of the conflicting user fails.

    -   Value = *emails\[0\].value*. If the service finds an existing user matching both unique attributes *email* and *personExternalID*, it updates this user with the data of the conflicting one. If the service finds an existing user matching only the *email*, the update of the existing user fails.

        If a user with such *email* is not found, that means the conflict is due to another reason, so the creation of the conflicting user fails.


    Possible values:

    -   *personExternalID*
    -   *emails\[0\].value*

    Default value: *personExternalID*

6.  \(Optional\) Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *SAP S/4HANA On-Premise* target system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules depending on your setup of entities in SAP S/4HANA On-Premise. For more information, see:

## Next Steps

-   Before starting a provisioning job, you can first subscribe for e-mail notifications from the source system you use in your scenario. This way, you will be notified by e-mail about eventual failed entities during the jobs. For more information, see [Manage Job Notifications](Monitoring-and-Reporting/manage-job-notifications-d055bc2.md).
-   Start an identity provisioning job. For more information, see [Monitor Provisioning Job Logs](Monitoring-and-Reporting/monitor-provisioning-job-logs-e5b5176.md).
