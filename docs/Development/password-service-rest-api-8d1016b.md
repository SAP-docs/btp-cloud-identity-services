# Password Service REST API

The password service is used for operations related to user passwords, such as verification of the user name and the password combination.



## Verify Username and Password Combination

Verify the username and password combination, or verify the thing ID and password combination.



## Request

**URI:**<code>https://&lt;Cloud Identity Services domain&gt;/service/users/password</code>

> ### Note:  
> The domain part has the following pattern:
> 
> `<tenant ID>.accounts.ondemand.com` or `<tenant ID>.accounts.cloud.sap`. If you have a configured custom domain, the domain has the following pattern: <your custom domain\>.
> 
> *Tenant ID* is an automatically generated ID by the system. The first administrator created for the tenant receives an activation email with a URL in it. This URL contains the *tenant ID*. For more information about your tenants, see [View Assigned Tenants and Admins](../view-assigned-tenants-and-admins-f56e6f2.md).

**HTTP Method:***POST*

`Basic` - Username and password are provided by the user.

> ### Note:  
> Depending on the allowed logon identifiers for the user, the username can be the `User ID`, `Login Name`, or `Email`. For more information, see [Configure Allowed Logon Identifiers](../Operation-Guide/configure-allowed-logon-identifiers-3adf1ff.md).

> ### Caution:  
> If the user provides wrong password, then each verification counts as a failed logon attempt. The password locks when the number of the allowed failed logon attempts is reached. The number depends on the password policy applied for the application. For more information, see [Configuring Password Policies](../Operation-Guide/configuring-password-policies-12b3395.md).
