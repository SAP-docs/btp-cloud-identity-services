# SCIM System

Follow this procedure to set up a SCIM system as а source system.



<a name="loio0d8e2be3bc544494999858f6ac518525__prereq_gfl_gvx_rdb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   \(Optional\) You have installed the Cloud Connector in your corporate environment and have done the initial configuration. You need this only if the SCIM system is exposed in a private corporate network. For more information, see [Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html).
-   You have technical user credentials for a SCIM system, with read/write access permissions, depending on the scenario you want to implement. In case OAuth is used for authentication, client ID and secret are required when creating a destination for access token retrieval.



## Context

Create a general SCIM 2.0 based source system to read users and groups from it.



## Procedure

1.  \(Optional\) If the SCIM system is exposed in a private corporate network, add an access control system mapping in Cloud Connector. For more information, see [Configure Access Control \(HTTP\)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/e7d4927dbb571014af7ef6ebd6cc3511.html).

2.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

3.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Source Systems*.

4.  Add *SCIM* as a source system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

5.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

    For example: `https://<token_provider>.com/api/oauth2/v2.0/token`
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    To learn what additional properties are relevant to this system, see [List of Properties](list-of-properties-d6f3577.md). You can use the main search, or filter properties by the *Name* or *System Type* columns.

6.  \(Optional\) Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *SCIM* source system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules to reflect your current setup of entities in your SCIM system. For more information, see [Manage Transformations](Operation-Guide/manage-transformations-2d0fbe5.md).

    -   **Mapping logic** – the behavior of the default transformation logic is to read all user attributes from the source SCIM system, and then map them to the internal SCIM representation. It uses `entityIdSourceSystem` to store the unique ID of the identity. The ID is removed by default, because it is specific for the source system.
    -   **User off-boarding** – it depends on the target system API. When a user is deleted from the SCIM system, the deletion status is considered and depends on the user status handling of the target system. The user will be either deleted or set as **inactive**.

    **Default transformation:**

    >             }

7.  Now, add a target system to provision users and groups into it. Choose from: [Target Systems](target-systems-ab3f641.md)

## Next Steps

-   Before starting a provisioning job, you can first subscribe for e-mail notifications from the source system you use in your scenario. This way, you will be notified by e-mail about eventual failed entities during the jobs. For more information, see [Manage Job Notifications](Monitoring-and-Reporting/manage-job-notifications-d055bc2.md).
-   Now, start an identity provisioning job. For more information, see [Monitor Provisioning Job Logs](Monitoring-and-Reporting/monitor-provisioning-job-logs-e5b5176.md).
