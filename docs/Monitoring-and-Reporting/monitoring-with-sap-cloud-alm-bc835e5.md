## Configuration & Security Analysis

With the Configuration & Security Analysis app of SAP Cloud ALM, you can check if your Identity ProvisioningSAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Provisioning tenants and provisioning systems are configured in alignment with the [Security recommendations for SAP Cloud Identity Services - Identity Provisioning](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-security-recommendations-c8a9bb59fe624f0981efa0eff2497d7d/sap-btp-security-recommendations?seclist-service=Identity+Provisioning&version=Cloud).

> ### Note:  
> Identity Provisioning reports data to SAP Cloud ALM daily. For more information, see [Monitor Security Recommendations with SAP Cloud ALM](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-btp-security-recommendations-c8a9bb59fe624f0981efa0eff2497d7d/monitor-security-recommendations-with-sap-cloud-alm?version=Cloud).

## Job & Automation Monitoring

In the Job & Automation Monitoring app, you can monitor the execution of your jobs using specific metrics. The supported provisioning job types are *Read* \(immediate and scheduled\), *Resync* and *Simulate*. In the Job & Automation Monitoring app they are grouped by system name and jоb type. You have the option to drill down from a specific row to the list of executed jobs.

For more information, see [Job & Automation Monitoring](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-alm/applicationhelp/job-automation-monitoring?locale=en-US%20and%20https://support.sap.com/ja/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/job-monitoring.html) and the [relevant section on the SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/ja/alm/sap-cloud-alm/operations/expert-portal/job-monitoring.html).
