# View Usage Statistics

You can view statistical information for a tenant in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.



## Context

The *Reporting* view displays a chart of statistical information with the number of the user logon requests. A logon request is a single authentication request managed via Identity Authentication. Identity Authentication counts only one logon request per user per day. Logon requests are independent of the authentication mechanism and user type.

The default statistical information shows the usage of the bundled, charged and system applications for the last six months. You can customize what you see by requesting information about specific applications and modifying the period.

Identity Authentication keeps the usage statistics for three years.

> ### Note:  
> If you need statistics for the period before August 2015, you can report an incident on [SAP Support Portal Home](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html) with a component `BC-IAM-IDS`.
