Problems that you might face when working with the end user screen.

## You need to remove the "Forgot password" link from the sign in screen

Symptom:

You need to remove the "Forgot Password" link from the Identity Authentication sign in screen. This can be a goal when the Corporate User Store is used, and the password is managed on the Corporate User Store itself, so the forgot password functionality would not be needed.

Solution:

See **KBA 2607588** - [How to remove Forgot Password link from Identity Authentication logon page](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2607588).
