## You need to remove the "Forgot password" link from the sign in screen

**Symptom:**

You need to remove the *Forgot Password* link from the Identity Authentication sign-in screen. This can be a goal when the Corporate User Store is used, and the password is managed on the Corporate User Store itself, so the forgot password functionality would not be needed.

**Solution:**

See **KBA 2607588** - [How to remove Forgot Password link from Identity Authentication logon page](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2607588).
