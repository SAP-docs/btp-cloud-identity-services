# Analyze Troubleshooting Logs with Support Log Assistant 2.0



## Context

The Support Log Assistant 2.0 is a tool that allows you to automatically scan and analyze text files such as logs, configuration files, or traces. The tool then suggests solutions to known issues found in the files and highlights important details that it finds. The tool is integrated into the incident logging procedure and is also available as a standalone tool.



## Procedure

1.  Access the tool via the following link: [Support Log Assistant 2.0](https://supportportal-pslogassistant-app.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/?source=IAS).

2.  Choose *Add Files*, and select the files that you want to analyze.

    No files are uploaded to SAP during this entire process. Your files are analyzed locally within your browser.

    Once the log files have been selected, they are scanned to identify what type of log file they are. The files that are identified are listed on the top. Under them are the files that can't be identified and scanned.

3.  Choose *Scan Files*, and select the *ALERTS*, *FILES*, or *ADDITIONAL DETAILS* tab.

4.  Choose *Summary* to see a short summary of the issues found and their solutions.
