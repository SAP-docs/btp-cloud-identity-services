## You receive error: Error: "Your domain is not trusted. Please contact your system administrator"

**Symptom**:

When using embedded frames or overlays in an application, which authenticates against the Identity Authentication Service, the following error is displayed when trying to log in via the domain of the overlay:

"Your domain is not trusted. Please contact your system administrator."

The other error can be related to trusted domains:

"Your request failed because the page you have to be redirected to is not trusted. Please contact your system administrator."

**Solution:**

See KBA **2739473****\-**["Your domain is not trusted. Please contact your system administrator" in Identity Authentication Service](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2739473)

## You receive error: "The digital signature of the received SAML2 message is invalid"

**Symptom:**

An Identity Authentication tenant returns the message: "The digital signature of the received SAML2 message is invalid" in subject when an authentication request is done from a specific Service Provider. This can be checked via a SAML trace \(see SAP KBA 2461862 [Collecting SAML traces with Chrome or Firefox](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2461862)\).

In case the Service Provider is an SAP BTP subaccount, 500 error on the screen can be seen.

In the [Troubleshooting log](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2942816), the following error is displayed:

"message=Identity Provider could not process the authentication request received due to error on its own side.An unexpected exception occurred. See call stack for details. Caused by: Signature of the SAML2 protocol token cannot be validated because neither primary nor secondary certificates are available in the configuration"

**Solution:**

See KBA 2645425 - [The digital signature of the received SAML2 message is invalid](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2645425)

## Integration with SAP IBP. IBP logon screen is received after authentication \(SSO does not work\)

**Symptom:**

-   You need to Integrate SAP Integrated Business Planning \(IBP\) with either SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication Service or a Corporate Identity Provider.
-   The authentication happens to IBP via SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication Service or Corporate Identity Provider, but the IBP logon screen is received after authentication \(SSO does not work\).

**Solution:**

See KBA 2659221 - [User authentication prerequisites for IBP with Identity Authentication Service or Corporate IdP](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2659221).

## SFSF password migration is not taking effect

**Symptom**

After provisioning users to IAS from SuccessFactors \(through IPS\), users cannot logon to SuccessFactors with a username and password. They use the forgot password link and get an error message on the IAS logon page:

"Passwords can only be changed once every %\{param0\} hours."

or

**Passwords can only be changed once every 24 hours.**

In IAS Troubleshooting logs with "WARN" Severity, you see error:

"Cannot send Forgot Password Mail to user with uid <P\_UserID\>. Reason: PASSWORD\_DISABLED. "

other factors are:

-   SuccessFactors password migration to IAS has been configured [Migrating Passwords from SAP SuccessFactors to the SAP Cloud Platform Identity Authentication Service \(IAS\)](https://help.sap.com/viewer/568fdf1f14f14fd089a3cd15194d19cc/latest/en-US/b25f3f36deed40ddb3aee14c6818df06.html).
-   Users with the issue are existing already in IAS **prior**to running the IPS sync job.
-   Users with the issue initially try to logon but their password doesn't work. They reset the password and try logon again. This is when the error is received.

**Solution:**

See KBA 2957801 - [SFSF password migration is not taking effect - "Passwords can only be changed once every %\{param0\} hours" upon forgot password](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2957801).
