## Email Activation

You have received an email from **notification@sapnetworkmail.com** or:

-   If you have already activated your account - You see the following error "E-Mail Already Activated" after youâ€™ve clicked the activation email link." E-Mail Already Activated. This message means that the Cloud Identity Services has already been activated. Use the "Forgot Password" option to gain access to your tenant.
-   If you haven't activated your account or didn't receive an email - Open your mail box and search for an e-mail from **ias@notifications.sap.com** or **notification@sapnetworkmail.com**. The email contains a link to activate your account. The following is possible:
    -   The link has expired - The system sends you a new activation email. Follow the procedure to activate your account.
    -   The link is invalid or already used, or you haven't received an email:
        -   Check your spam folder
        -   Contact an existing tenant administrator for the tenant to ask the following.

            -   Whether an activation email was sent \(or if only an initial password was set, since this case no email is sent\).
            -   To resend the activation email.
