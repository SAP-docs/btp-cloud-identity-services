# SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\)

Follow this procedure to set up a SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\) as Ð° target system.



<a name="loiof5cefa9509d64b0a8aeab24a895feec5__prereq_l4f_cnz_scc"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have a global account in SAP BTP with at least one multi-environment subaccount with enabled Cloud Foundry environment.

-   You have added SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\) as a source system for the same Cloud Foundry landscape and executed successfully a read job. For more information, see [SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\)](sap-btp-platform-members-cloud-foundry-027324d.md).



## Context

The Cloud Foundry environment enables you to create polyglot cloud applications in Cloud Foundry. It contains the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry runtime service, which is based on the open-source application platform managed by the Cloud Foundry Foundation. For more information, see [Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/cloud-foundry-environment?version=Cloud).

When you enable the Cloud Foundry environment in your subaccount, the system automatically creates a Cloud Foundry organization for you. You are able to add platform users as org members and space members and assign roles to grant these users platform access. For more information, see [Valid role types](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.126.0/index.html#valid-role-types).

SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\) connector manages org and space members, as well as their role assignments, in the Cloud Foundry environment of a multi-environment subaccount, where a **single** SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant acts as custom identity provider. We recommend that you use the Identity Provisioning service enabled in this SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant.

> ### Note:  
> Identity Provisioning bundle tenants delivered before March 15, 2022, and Identity Provisioning standalone tenants delivered before September 1, 2020, run on SAP BTP, Neo environment. Customers with tenants on Neo environment are encouraged to migrate them to the SAP Cloud Identity Services infrastructure.
> 
> For more information, see [Migrate Identity Provisioning Bundle Tenant](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-provisioning/identity-provisioning/migrate-identity-provisioning-bundle-tenant).

In SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\), groups correspond to roles in particular Cloud Foundry orgs or spaces, thus group members are user assignments of a role in a specific Cloud Foundry org or space. Group names must follow a defined pattern, explained below, to ensure the correct mapping and provisioning of users and their role assignments to the relevant Cloud Foundry organization or space.

> ### Note:  
> The attribute *name*, defined within the *urn:sap:cloud:scim:schemas:extension:custom:2.0:Group* schema, is used to map the users and user assignments of a role to the relevant Cloud Foundry organization or space. The group names follow the respective patterns:
> 
> -   organization group name: `<org_ID> <org_role>`
> -   space group name: `<org_ID> <space_ID> <space_role>`, where `space_ID` can be retrieved using the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface by executing the command `cf space --guid`.
> 
> 
> Whereas the group display names adhere to the following patterns:
> 
> -   organization group display name: `<btp.cf.pm.group.prefix>_<btp.cf.pm.landscape>:<org_name>:<org_role>`
> -   space group display name: `<btp.cf.pm.group.prefix>_<btp.cf.pm.landscape>:<org_name>:<space_name>:<space_role>`

The target system consumes User Account and Authentication API and Cloud Foundry V3 API provided by Cloud Foundry.

> ### Remember:  
> This connector enables you to write users and user role assignments to Cloud Foundry on *subaccount* level. For provisioning of users and groups to Cloud Foundry on *application* level, refer to [SAP BTP XS Advanced UAA \(Cloud Foundry\)](sap-btp-xs-advanced-uaa-cloud-foundry-ecddce6.md). For more information, see [SAP BTP Integration Scenario](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-identity/system-integration-guide/sap-btp-integration-scenario?version=Cloud).

Follow the steps below to create SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\) as a target system to provision users and user role assignments.

> ### Note:  
> In case you have Cloud Foundry environment enabled in multiple Cloud Foundry landscapes or more than one SAP Cloud Identity Services tenants, you must configure a separate SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\) connector for each of them.



## Procedure

1.  To enable provisioning of platform users and user role assignments to and from Cloud Foundry environment, create a Support Ticket on component BC-CP-CF-SEC-IAM.

    Specify your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant ID and the origin key of the trust configuration for BTP platform users which points to your SAP Cloud Identity Services tenant. You can find the origin key value in the SAP BTP cockpit. Go to your SAP BTP subaccount, choose *Trust Configuration* and see the value under *Origin Key* for the relevant *Custom Identity Provider for Platform Users*.

2.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

3.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Target Systems*.

4.  Add *SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\)* as a target system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

5.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

    To learn what additional properties are relevant to this system, see [List of Properties](list-of-properties-d6f3577.md). You can use the main search, or filter properties by the *Name* or *System Type* columns.

6.  \(Optional\) Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\)* target system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules to reflect your current setup of entities in your SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\) system. For more information, see:

    [Manage Transformations](Operation-Guide/manage-transformations-2d0fbe5.md)

    [Cloud Foundry V3 API](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.178.0/index.html)

    -   **Mapping logic** â The behavior of the default transformation logic is to map all attributes from the internal SCIM representation to the SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\) target attributes.
    -   **User offboarding** â If a user has been deleted from the source system, this change is recognized, and the user is deleted from the SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\) target system too.

    > ### Note:  
    > Update operation is skipped for users in the default write transformation.

    > ### Caution:  
    > Keep in mind that when you add or delete users and user role assignments in SAP BTP Platform Members \(Cloud Foundry\), the operations order must adhere to the Cloud Foundry Environment hierarchy. In this case, you can expect the following behavior:
    > 
    > -   When adding a user as space member, it must already be present as member of the relevant organization with assigned role **Org User**. When deleting an org member, it should be first removed from the spaces of the relevant organization. In case you end up with erroneous entity structure, you can manually add or delete users via the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services.
    > 
    > -   When adding user role assignments, you should first add the org roles and afterwards proceed with the space roles. Also, when deleting user role assignments, you should first delete the space roles and then proceed with the org roles. If this condition is not fullfiled the job will finish with error. In that case, you can rerun the job until it finishes successfully.

    **Default transformation:**

    >       }
    >     ]
    >   }
    > }
    > ```

7.  Now, add a source system from which to read users and user role assignments. For example: [Identity Authentication](identity-authentication-e4e25f1.md)[Local Identity Directory](local-identity-directory-8c7d05e.md)

## Next Steps

-   Before starting a provisioning job, you can first subscribe for e-mail notifications from the source system you use in your scenario. This way, you will be notified by e-mail about eventual failed entities during the jobs. For more information, see [Manage Job Notifications](Monitoring-and-Reporting/manage-job-notifications-d055bc2.md).
-   Start an identity provisioning job. For more information, see [Monitor Provisioning Job Logs](Monitoring-and-Reporting/monitor-provisioning-job-logs-e5b5176.md).
