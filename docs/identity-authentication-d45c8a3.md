# Identity Authentication

Follow this procedure to set up SAP Cloud Identity Service – Identity Authentication as a proxy system.



<a name="loiod45c8a331b8d4706bc2af3f0d6027a72__prereq_ezp_nrh_vdb"/>

## Prerequisites

To establish the connection between Identity Provisioning and Identity Authentication, you need to set up the technical user \(of type *System*\) in Identity Authentication and assign this user the necessary authorizations. You have the option to do it either now, as a prerequisite, or while configuring Identity Authentication as a proxy system, as described in step 5.

> ### Note:  
> Administrators of bundle tenants on Neo environment should enable the *Manage OAuth Clients* permission, as described in *Neo Environment* section in [Manage Authorizations](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/544de9b504214372b4479dc1f6b08cca.html "Manage the authorizations of Identity Provisioning administrators, when your bundle or standalone tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment.") :arrow_upper_right:.

## Context

Identity Authentication provides authentication and single sign-on for users in the cloud.

You can use the Identity Provisioning user interface \(UI\) to configure Identity Authentication as a proxy system for hybrid integration, where Identity Authentication is connected to an external identity management system for user and group provisioning. Using the Identity Provisioning you can read corporate users from the external system and provision them to the Identity Authentication user store \(and the other way around\) without making a direct connection between these systems. This way, you can implement secure authentication, single sign-on \(SSO\), strong authentication, and mobile SSO so that the provisioned users to Identity Authentication have access to the business applications of your company.

The proxy systems consume SCIM 2.0 API which is provided by Identity Authentication.

There are two versions of the Identity Authentication SCIM API. They are handled by the `ias.api.version` property as follows:

-   When the value is set to `1` or the property is not defined \(typical for systems created before versioning was introduced on July 9, 2021\) - Identity Authentication SCIM API \(in short, SCIM API version 1\) is used.

    For more information on how to update to version 2, see [Update Connector Version](Operation-Guide/update-connector-version-8558733.md)

-   When the value is set to `2` - Identity Directory SCIM API \(in short, SCIM API version 2\) is used. This value is set automatically for all manually created systems in the Identity Provisioning UI after versioning was introduced on July 9, 2021.


SCIM API version 2 is enhanced to support patch operations for proxy systems only, paging for group members and user’s groups, custom attributes, delta read mode for users. Also, the group resource mapping in the transformation is not ignored by default, as it is in SCIM API version 1.

To create Identity Authentication as a proxy system, proceed as follows:



## Procedure

1.  Open your subaccount in SAP BTP cockpit \(valid for OAuth authentication to the Identity Provisioning proxy system\).

    > ### Note:  
    > If you have a bundle tenant, then in the cockpit → *Neo* → *Overview*, you can see the Global account, which SAP provides for your bundle in the corresponding Identity Provisioning region. Then, in the global account, you can see your subaccount, where the Identity Provisioning is enabled as a service for the bundle. The display name of the subaccount starts with **SAP\_BUNDLE**.

2.  Sign in to the administration console of SAP Cloud Identity Services and navigate to *Users & Authorizations* \> *Administrators*.

3.  Create a technical user with the necessary authorizations. It will later be used by the external consumer to connect to Identity Provisioning.

    -   For **Certificate-based authentication**, follow the procedure in [Manage Certificates for Inbound Connection](Operation-Guide/manage-certificates-for-inbound-connection-952e7c7.md) → *SAP BTP, Neo Environment*

    -   For **OAuth authentication**, proceed as follows:

        1.  Go to *Security* \> *OAuth* \> *Clients* and choose *Register New Client*.

        2.  From the *Subscription* combo box, select **<provider\_subaccount\>/ipsproxy**.

        3.  From the *Authorization Grant* combo box, select **Client Credentials**.

        4.  In the *Secret* field, enter a password \(client secret\) and remember it. You will need it later, for the repository configuration in the external system.

        5.  Copy/paste and save \(in a notepad\) the generated *Client ID*. You will need it later, too.

        6.  From the left-side navigation, choose *Subscriptions* \> *Java Applications* \> *ipsproxy* .

        7.  From the left-side navigation, choose *Roles* \> *IPS\_PROXY\_USER*.

        8.  Choose *Assign* and enter **oauth\_client\_<client\_ID\>**.

            For *<client\_ID\>*, enter the one you have saved in the previous main step.


    -   For **Certificate-based authentication**, upload the certificate for the technical user of type *System*, as described in [Add System as Administrator](https://help.sap.com/docs/identity-authentication/identity-authentication/add-administrators?version=Cloud#add-system-as-administrator) and enable the *Access Proxy System API* permission.

    -   For **Basic authentication**, proceed as follows:

        1.  Add an administrator user of type **System** and configure the basic authentication method for this user.

            If you already have a technical user, skip this step.

        2.  Save your changes.

        3.  Select your administrator user of type **System** and enable the *Access Proxy System API* permission.

        4.  Save your changes.



4.  Access the Identity Provisioning UI.

    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Bundle Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/7ab5884ffbc44461a57622d2f633e57c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning UI when the service is bundled as part of an SAP cloud solution's license.") :arrow_upper_right:
    -   [Access Identity Provisioning UI of Standalone Tenants](https://help.sap.com/viewer/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/Cloud/en-US/61fd82ed48ab42b2bc74626926c1722c.html "Access the Identity Provisioning user interface as a standalone product.") :arrow_upper_right:

5.  Navigate to *Identity Provisioning* \> *Proxy Systems*.

6.  Add *Identity Authentication* as a proxy system. For more information, see [Add New Systems](Operation-Guide/add-new-systems-bd214dc.md).

7.  Set up the communication between Identity Provisioning and Identity Authentication and configure your authentication method \(basic or certificate-based\).

    > ### Note:  
    > We recommend that you use certificate-based authentication.

    1.  In your newly added Identity Authentication proxy system, select the *Certificate* tab and choose *Generate* \> *Download*, as described in [Manage Certificates](Operation-Guide/manage-certificates-86d06a0.md).

        Skip step **a.** if you want to use basic authentication.

        In SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console, perform the next steps. They are relevant for both basic and certificate-based authentication.

    2.  [Add System as administrator](https://help.sap.com/viewer/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/Cloud/en-US/bbbdbdd3899942ce874f3aae9ba9e21d.html#loiocefb742a36754b18bbe5c3503ac6d87c) and provide the respective credentials.

        For basic authentication, provide a password. The user ID will be generated automatically when you set the password for the first time.

        For certificate-based authentication, upload the certificate you have generated in SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console on the previous step.

    3.  Save your changes.

    4.  Make sure *Manage Users* and *Manage Groups* authorization roles are enabled for the technical user. This way, you can create, edit and delete users and groups in the Identity Authentication user store.


8.  Choose the *Properties* tab to configure the connection settings for your system.

    > ### Note:  
    > If your tenant is running on SAP BTP, Neo environment, you can create a [connectivity destination](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/72696d6d06c0490394ac3069da600278.html) in your subaccount in the SAP BTP cockpit, and then select it from the *Destination Name* combo box in your Identity Provisioning User Interface.
    > 
    > If one and the same property exists both in the cockpit and in the *Properties* tab, the value set in the *Properties* tab is considered with higher priority.
    > 
    > We recommend that you use the *Properties* tab. Use a connectivity destination only if you need to reuse one and the same configuration for multiple provisioning systems.

9.  \(Optional\) Configure the transformations.

    Transformations are used to map the user attributes from the data model of the source system to the data model of the target system, and the other way around. The Identity Provisioning offers a default transformation for the *Identity Authentication* proxy system, whose settings are displayed under the *Transformations* tab after saving its initial configuration.

    You can change the default transformation mapping rules to reflect your current setup of entities in your Identity Authentication system. For more information, see: [Manage Transformations](Operation-Guide/manage-transformations-2d0fbe5.md)

    SCIM API version 2: [Identity Directory SCIM API](https://api.sap.com/api/IdDS_SCIM/resource)

    Default read and write transformations:

    > ### Tip:  
    > The proxy *Read Transformation* is used when the external client application \(for example, SAP Identity Management\) makes initial load. That is, executing GET requests to the resource endpoints \(**/Users** or **/Groups**\) to retrieve the corresponding entities of the particular type. The external client application can also execute GET requests to a single resource endpoint \(querying a single resource is supported\). In this case, the proxy system acts as a *source* one.
    > 
    > The proxy *Write Transformation* is used when the external application manages the entities in the proxy system – creates new entities, updates existing ones, or deletes existing ones. In this case, the proxy system acts as a *target* one.
    > 
    > However, after a *Create* or *Update* operation is performed on the proxy system, the *Read Transformation* is applied to the result, so that the created or updated entity is sent back to the external application. This behavior demonstrates that the proxy *Read Transformation* is used for *write* cases, as well.

    > ### Remember:  
    > If you set `$.userType` to "**public**", all passwords will be written by default in the Identity Authentication. Thus, all provisioned users will successfully sign in to Identity Authentication target system.
    > 
    > When `$.userType` is set to "**employee**", the sign-in behavior of the provisioned users depends on whether users have been created with or without a password, and where these passwords are stored. Thus, you need to modify the target transformations accordingly in order for the users to successfully sign in to the SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console.
    > 
    > To learn more, see *Guided Answers*: [Identity Authentication: Provisioned Users Can't Sign In](https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/#/tree/2065/actions/26547:29111:29114:27412:31549) 

10. Connect the external consumer to Identity Provisioning with the technical user you have created in step 2.

    If the external consumer system is **SAP Identity Management**, you can export the newly created proxy system as a SCIM repository from Identity Provisioning and import it in SAP Identity Management. This will create a SCIM repository in SAP Identity Management where most of the repository constants will be automatically filled in. You need to provide the technical user credentials that you have set up in step 2 and the SCIM assignment method as described below:

    -   For AUTH\_USER and AUTH\_PASSWORD, enter your client ID and secret.

    -   For the SCIM\_ASSIGNMENT\_METHOD constant, make sure the value is **PUT**.


    -   For AUTH\_USER and AUTH\_PASSWORD, enter the user ID and password of the Identity Authentication technical user for which you have set permission *Access Proxy System API*.

    -   For the SCIM\_ASSIGNMENT\_METHOD constant, make sure the value is **PUT**.


    > ### Note:  
    > For external consumer systems, other than SAP Identity Management, you should also use the **PUT** method for modifying entities.

## Next Steps

When a proxy system is connected to an external backend system \(in the case of SAP Identity Management this means the exported CSV file is imported into the Identity Management Admin UI and a repository is configured\), you can start managing the users and groups into this external system. Usually, the first operation is the initial load of the existing entities into your external system. When this load has finished, changes in the external system, such as creating new users or updating existing ones, can trigger CRUD requests back to the proxy system.
