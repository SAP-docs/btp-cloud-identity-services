# Groups

SAP Cloud Identity Services offers groups to organize users based on common characteristics, authorization, or application. Use them to efficiently manage user access and permissions within your organization's SAP Cloud Identity Services environment.

There are two kinds of groups in SAP Cloud Identity Services - *user groups* and *authorization groups*, and one special group - *application-specific groups*.

The following sections explain the different groups.

## User Groups

The user groups serve to create sets of users who have something in common. An example for a user group is a group of users who work in the same department, or users who have similar tasks in a company.

The type of these groups in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services is *User Group*.

For more information, see [Managing Groups](Operation-Guide/managing-groups-ddd067c.md).

## Authorization Groups

The authorization groups are related to authorization of users, groups or applications.

The groups that result from the creation of authorization represent the authorization policies that are available in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services. When you create a new authorization, a group with the same name is also created and appears in the list of the groups. Initially, only the authorization groups related to the base authorization policies are visible.

> ### Restriction:  
> You can't modify or delete an authorization group that is related to an authorization policy via the administration console.

The type of these groups in the administration console is *Authorization*

For more information, see [Managing Groups](Operation-Guide/managing-groups-ddd067c.md), [Configure Authorizations Based on Policies](Operation-Guide/configure-authorizations-based-on-policies-08fea39.md) and [Configuring Authorization Policies](Operation-Guide/configuring-authorization-policies-982ac5f.md).

## Application-Specific Groups

The application-specific groups are a special kind of groups which are bound to an application and can be created in the Identity Directory of SAP Cloud Identity Services by running provisioning jobs, or via the administration console. For more information, see [Start and Stop Provisioning Jobs](Operation-Guide/start-and-stop-provisioning-jobs-531a261.md) and [Create a Group](Operation-Guide/create-a-group-b1b638d.md).

The extension schema of the Identity Directory API *urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:sap:2.0:Group* defines the following three attributes:

-   *applicationId* - supported only for the Local Identity Directory default write and proxy write transformations as mandatory attribute. The value of this attribute is provided from the source system by setting the property ips.application.id. For more information, see [List of Properties](list-of-properties-d6f3577.md) â†’`ips.application.id`.

-   *type* - supported by theLocal Identity Directory source, target, and proxy provisioning systems as optional attribute. If no value is specified in the write or proxy write default transformations, the default value*'userGroup'* is set.

-   *supportedOperations* - supported byLocal Identity Directory source, target, and proxy provisioning systems as optional attribute. If no value is specified in the write or proxy write default transformations, the default value *'readWrite'* is set. The attribute defines the supported update options for the application-specific group.


The application-specific groups appear with their name in the *Application Name* column in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services under the *Groups* tile. The *Application Name* column for the groups that aren't application-specific is empty.

> ### Restriction:  
> You must be assigned to a policy that allows reading applications, or to the *Manage Applications* role to view *Application Name* column. For more information, see [Configure User Authorizations](Operation-Guide/configure-user-authorizations-424b64c.md).

The application-specific groups can be of the following types:
