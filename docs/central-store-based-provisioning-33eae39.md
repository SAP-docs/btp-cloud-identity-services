# Central Store-Based Provisioning

Central store-based provisioning enables the automatic provisioning of application-specific groups from the Identity Directory to the target systems whenever changes occur. These changes include user assignments or modifications of group attributes.

## Prerequisites

To ensure the groups immediate provisioning to the target systems, the following application configurations are required:

-   An application must be created for the relevant target system under *Applications & Resources* \> *Applications*. See [Create a New Application](Operation-Guide/create-a-new-application-0d4b255.md).

-   The application ID must be set as the value for the `ips.application.id` property in the target system.

    See [List of Properties](list-of-properties-d6f3577.md).

-   The *Central Store-Based Provisioning* option must be enabled under *Applications & Resources* \> *Applications* \> *Provisioning*. See [Enable or Disable Central Store-Based Provisioning](Operation-Guide/enable-or-disable-central-store-based-provisioning-657bbaa.md).

## Context

You can initially create application-specific groups in the Identity Directory in the following ways: by running a provisioning job from a given source system, manually through the directoryâ€™s user interface in the SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console or programmatically using the Identity Directory SCIM API.

For more information, see [Groups](groups-d93be69.md) and [User and Group Creation in Identity Directory](user-and-group-creation-in-identity-directory-efcb839.md).

When provisioning application-specific groups from the Identity Directory to target systems, groups that do not already exist in the target will be created. However, if you assign users to an application-specific group in the directory, this assignment will only be provisioned if the users already exist in the target system. Note that central store-based provisioning does not create users in the target system.

## Procedure

Here is the necessary configuration to enable central store-based provisioning. The following example uses the Local Identity Directory as the source system and SAP Advanced Financial Closing as the target system.

1.  Sign in to SAP Cloud Identity Services administration console and navigate to *Identity Provisioning*.

2.  Add [Local Identity Directory](local-identity-directory-8c7d05e.md) as a source system.

3.  **Optional**: Configure properties that are relevant for the Local Identity Directory source system, for example `idds.user.filter` and `idds.group.filter`. For more information, see [List of Properties](list-of-properties-d6f3577.md).

4.  **Optional**: Review and adapt the default read transformations as necessary.

5.  Add a target system of your choice, for example *SAP Advanced Financial Closing*.

6.  Select the *Local Identity Directory* as relevant source system.
7.  Set the property `ips.application.id` for the target system. For more information, see [List of Properties](list-of-properties-d6f3577.md).
8.  Start a read job from the *Local Identity Directory* source system.

9.  Navigate to your application in the administration console for SAP Cloud Identity Services under *Applications & Resources* \> *Applications* and enable the *Central Store-Based Provisioning*. For more information, see [Enable or Disable Central Store-Based Provisioning](Operation-Guide/enable-or-disable-central-store-based-provisioning-657bbaa.md).

## Result

Once the procedure is executed, any change to an attribute value or a member of an application-specific group in the Local Identity Directory will trigger instant provisioning of the modified entity to the configured target system.
